title: Beyond The Individual with Will Johncock

description: >-
  I had an insightful discussion with Will Johncock about his book, "Beyond the
  Individual." Will explored the themes of Stoicism, particularly how it
  emphasizes community and connection rather than just individualism. As a
  philosopher and academic, he delved into Stoicism's perspectives on
  individualism and collectivism, highlighting the importance of understanding
  where we as individuals end and where the rest of the world begins.

  He discussed his academic journey, noting how he became interested in Stoicism
  during his graduate studies in philosophy and sociology. Will explained the
  concept of Oikeiôsis, emphasizing the Stoic belief in the interconnectedness
  of all beings and the shared mind. This concept challenges the modern
  interpretations of Stoicism that focus heavily on individual resilience and
  self-improvement. Instead, Will's approach highlights the Stoic view of our
  social nature and responsibilities to others.

  The podcast also touched on practical applications of Stoic principles in
  modern life, like parenting and education. Will argued for incorporating Stoic
  values in early education to foster a sense of community and connectedness
  from a young age. He addressed the challenges posed by contemporary
  individualistic interpretations of Stoicism, advocating for a more nuanced and
  traditional understanding of the philosophy.

  For those interested in exploring these themes further, Will Johncock's book
  "Beyond the Individual" offers a detailed and accessible exploration of
  Stoicism's focus on community and connection. The book is available for
  purchase online, and it provides a fresh perspective on Stoic philosophy,
  challenging some of the more individualistic interpretations prevalent today.
