title: Dealing With Our Heartbreak Stoically

description: >-
  In this episode I delve into the painful experience of losing a relationship,
  particularly one that we didn't want to end. I highlight the acute distress
  caused by breakups, where someone actively chooses to leave, unlike death,
  which is inevitable and beyond anyone's control. I discuss how
  Stoicism-inspired reasoning can help alleviate the pain of heartache and
  navigate through the grief that follows a breakup.

  I emphasize the concept of "indifferents" in Stoicism, things that have no
  power over our ability to choose virtuously. These indifferents prompt us to
  make choices, but they do not dictate the choices we ultimately make.

  The episode clarifies the distinction between "indifferents" and
  "indifference," explaining that Stoics do not treat indifferents with
  indifference. Rather, they carefully consider how their choices regarding
  indifferents reflect their character and virtue.

  Furthermore, Stoic role ethics are introduced, emphasizing the importance of
  fulfilling one's roles in life responsibly. The host explains that heartache
  can hinder our ability to fulfill our roles effectively and underscores the
  need to address heartache as an indifferent that could impede our progress
  toward cultivating a good character.

  Practical steps for coping with heartbreak are provided, including acceptance,
  understanding that another person's unhappiness does not define your worth,
  focusing on fulfilling other roles in life, and practicing self-care.

  Overall, the episode offers a Stoic perspective on navigating the emotional
  turmoil of heartbreak with rationality and self-care, emphasizing the
  importance of understanding and accepting indifferents while striving to
  fulfill one's roles in life responsibly.
