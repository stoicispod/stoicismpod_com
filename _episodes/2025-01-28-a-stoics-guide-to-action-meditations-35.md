  In this episode, Tanner explores Meditations 3.5 by Marcus Aurelius, diving
  into its core teachings about Stoic ethics and virtuous living. The meditation
  emphasizes acting with integrity, examining one’s motives, and focusing on
  moral reasoning rather than outcomes. Tanner reflects on Marcus’s invocation
  of the “God within” as a call to internalize virtue and gratitude, encouraging
  listeners to appreciate life, even during adversity. The discussion
  underscores the Stoic principle of striving for progress rather than
  perfection, illustrating how even imperfect circumstances can foster growth.


  MEDITATION TEXT


  “Do not act unwillingly nor selfishly nor without self-examination, nor with
  divergent motives. Let no affectation veneer your thinking. Be neither a busy
  talker, nor a busybody. Moreover let the God within be the guardian of a real
  man, a man of ripe years, a statesman, a Roman, a magistrate, who has taken
  his post like one waiting for the Retreat to sound, ready to depart, needing
  no oath nor any man as witness. And see that you have gladness of face, no
  need of service from without nor the peace that other men bestow. You should
  stand upright, not be held upright.” (Meditations 3.5)


  TAKEAWAYS


  — Stoics should act justly and logically, focusing on their motives rather
  than outcomes.

  — Virtue is accessible to anyone who earnestly pursues it, regardless of
  background.

  — Life’s challenges are fleeting opportunities to grow in gratitude and work
  toward Virtue.
