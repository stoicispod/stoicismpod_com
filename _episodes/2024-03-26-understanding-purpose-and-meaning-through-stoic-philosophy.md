description: >-
  In this enlightening episode of "Practical Stoicism," I delve into the
  profound realization that the search for purpose and meaning in life becomes
  increasingly urgent as we age. I explore the journey from the invincibility
  felt in youth to the mature quest for fulfillment, highlighting the importance
  of discovering a purpose that transcends the expectations of others. Drawing
  on the wisdom of Stoic philosophy and the teachings of Epictetus and
  Agrippinus, I've come to understand that true purpose is a deeply personal
  voyage towards enlightenment, free from the constraints of conformity and
  rebellion. Join me as I navigate the path to uncovering our individual essence
  through the lens of Stoicism, offering insights into how to lead a life marked
  by virtue and excellence.
