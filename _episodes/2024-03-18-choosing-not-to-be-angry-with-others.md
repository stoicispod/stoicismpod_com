description: >-
  In today's episode, we embark on a Stoic journey to manage anger, exploring
  how Stoicism provides practical tools for transforming our emotional
  responses. I delve into the Stoic distinctions between proto-emotions and
  assented-to emotions, illustrating how understanding these concepts can
  empower us to master our anger. By examining the role of impressions and the
  importance of not hastily giving assent, I share insights on how we can
  approach life's challenges with a calm and rational mindset. Join me as we
  discover Stoicism's timeless wisdom for managing anger and leading a more
  harmonious life.
