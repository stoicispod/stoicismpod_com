title: Why the Stoics Urge Us to Act Before Time and Reason Fade (Meditations 3.1)
date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 10:00:00 -0000
description: >-
  Today we begin Book 3 of Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. Meditation 3.1
  reminds us that our time is limited—not just by death, but by the potential
  loss of our rational faculty as we age. Marcus writes that even if life
  continues, our ability to reason, comprehend, and adapt to events may
  diminish. He urges us to press forward with our pursuit of Virtue while we
  still have the capacity to live thoughtfully and intentionally.

  Memento Mori—the practice of remembering our mortality—grounds Stoic practice,
  but Marcus reminds us that it is not a lifehack to achieve personal goals or
  ambitions. Instead, it’s a practice rooted in the Stoic commitment to living
  in alignment with Nature and contributing to the greater good of the
  Cosmopolis. This meditation challenges us to reflect on how we use the present
  moment, which is the only time truly within our power, to make progress toward
  Virtue.

  "We ought to take into account not only the fact that day by day life is being
  spent and a smaller balance remaining, but this further point also that,
  should we live longer, it is at least doubtful whether the intellect will
  hereafter be the same." - Meditations 3.1
