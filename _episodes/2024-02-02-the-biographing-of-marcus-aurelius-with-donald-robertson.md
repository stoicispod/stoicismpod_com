  Donald Robertson joins Tanner Campbell to discuss his new book, "Marcus
  Aurelius: The Stoic Emperor," published by Yale University Press. The
  conversation delves into the life and philosophy of Marcus Aurelius, shedding
  light on both well-documented and lesser-known aspects of his reign.

  Robertson emphasizes the substantial amount of information available about
  Marcus Aurelius, more so than for most other ancient philosophers. Despite
  historical gaps and unreliable sources, a wealth of details about his reign,
  personal writings, and even his appearance at various stages of life is
  accessible. This rich trove of information provides a detailed picture of his
  life, philosophy, and the era he lived in.

  An interesting topic discussed is Marcus Aurelius's engagement in activities
  such as leading a dance troupe known as the "College of the Salii" or "The
  Leaping Priests." This group performed martial dances in honor of Mars, the
  god of war, serving both a religious function and preparing young men for
  military service. The discussion portrays Marcus Aurelius as a multifaceted
  emperor deeply involved in the cultural and religious practices of his time.

  The conversation also touches on the historical and personal challenges Marcus
  Aurelius encountered, including the political intrigue and his complex
  relationship with Hadrian. Robertson suggests that the environment of
  suspicion and surveillance under Hadrian likely influenced Marcus Aurelius's
  philosophical reflections and his cautious approach to governance.

  Furthermore, Robertson explores potential controversies and interpretations
  surrounding Marcus Aurelius's life, particularly his upbringing under
  Hadrian's influence. The dialogue hints at the darker aspects of Roman society
  and governance, including exploitation and manipulation at the highest levels
  of power.

  Robertson's insights into Marcus Aurelius extend beyond his philosophical
  musings, offering a glimpse into his personal experiences and the societal
  norms of his era. The book promises a comprehensive and nuanced portrayal of
  one of Stoicism's most revered figures, supported by thorough research and
  historical accuracy.

  This episode anticipates the revelations in "Marcus Aurelius: The Stoic
  Emperor" and underscores the importance of understanding historical figures
  within the full context of their lives. Robertson’s work aims to provide a
  detailed exploration of the Stoic emperor’s life and legacy.

  For those interested in Donald Robertson's examination of Marcus Aurelius,
  "Marcus Aurelius: The Stoic Emperor" is available on Amazon.
