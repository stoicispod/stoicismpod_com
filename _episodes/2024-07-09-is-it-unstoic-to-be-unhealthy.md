title: Is It UnStoic To Be Unhealthy?
date: Tue, 09 Jul 2024 10:46:27 -0000
description: >-
  In this episode, I open up about my own health challenges, sharing that while
  I am "blood healthy", I am also carrying around some excess weight. This
  personal context sets the stage for a broader discussion on health and
  Stoicism.

  I emphasize that taking care of our bodies is generally morally appropriate,
  but our approach to health must be contextually related to our abilities and
  circumstances. Stoicism teaches that the moral judgment of our approach to
  health is not linked to outcomes but to the moral reasoning guiding our
  actions.

  I discuss the importance of balancing our roles and ensuring they do not
  conflict with one another. Using the example of a university student named
  David, I illustrate how different roles must be fulfilled in harmony, without
  one undermining another. David’s approach to health is contextually
  appropriate, balancing his roles as a student, family member, partner, friend,
  and aspiring Stoic.

  I also address the misconceptions promoted by some "Stoic" masculinity
  influencers, who wrongly associate Stoicism with physical prowess and
  aggressive masculinity. True Stoicism is about logically understanding reality
  and making just moral choices, not about meeting arbitrary physical standards.

  The key takeaway is that while physical health is an indifferent, our choices
  regarding health are not. Making contextually appropriate efforts toward
  health is a reflection of our moral character. I urge listeners to be honest
  with themselves about their efforts and to avoid using Stoic concepts as
  excuses for inaction.

  Join me as I explore the intersection of health and Stoicism, and how we can
  make virtuous choices to support our well-being.
