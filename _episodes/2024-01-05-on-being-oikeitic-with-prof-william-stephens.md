date: Fri, 05 Jan 2024 10:00:00 -0000
description: >-
  In today's episode of Practical Stoicism, I'm thrilled to bring back Professor
  William Stephens for a deep dive into Oikeiôsis, the theme of this month. We
  delve into its ancient Stoic roots and its relevance in contemporary life,
  exploring how it helps us understand what is truly ours to be concerned with.
  Oikeiôsis, a term that signifies the recognition of what is akin or
  appropriate to us, extends our concern beyond ourselves to our family,
  community, humanity, and the entire biosphere. Professor Stephens clarifies
  that while Oikeiôsis is a uniquely Stoic term, its principles are universally
  applicable, emphasizing our interconnection with all living things and the
  wider world.

  Our conversation also tackles misconceptions of Stoicism, highlighting that
  it's not merely a life hack or a path to personal success but a profound guide
  for ethical living and community engagement. We discuss how Stoicism,
  especially through the concept of Oikeiôsis, informs our sense of justice and
  moral duty, urging us to consider our roles and responsibilities within the
  vast network of relationships that define our lives.

  As we conclude, we touch upon the critical issue of environmental
  responsibility, linking the Stoic view of Oikeiôsis to contemporary concerns
  like global warming. This episode is a reminder that Stoicism, with its
  emphasis on virtue and common good, offers timeless wisdom for navigating the
  complexities of modern life and contributing positively to the world around
  us. Join us as we explore these ancient yet ever-relevant ideas and how they
  can inspire us to lead more thoughtful, interconnected lives.
