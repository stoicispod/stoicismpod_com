description: >-
  Anya Leonard is my friend and one of my heroes. She's built something really
  incredible over the last 10-years (ClassicalWisdom.com) and I think it is as
  important a contribution to mankind as was Britannica compiling the great
  works of Western literature - she has create a "great works" platform and she
  provides it for free to everyone. This makes her not just a friend and a hero
  but also a comrade in arms. In today's episode you'll learn about Anya, some
  of her history, what inspired her to start Classical Wisdom more than a decade
  ago, and also about an upcoming talk she's giving at the Plato's Academy
  Centre on philosophy and kids.
