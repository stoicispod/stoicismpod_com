title: Making morally just decisions (Meditations 2.6)
date: Mon, 23 Sep 2024 13:49:00 -0000
description: >-
  In this episode, I explore Meditation 6 from Book 2 of Meditations, where
  Marcus Aurelius reflects on how we often fail to honor our own well-being,
  instead placing it in the hands of others. I dive into the Stoic concept of
  violence, explaining that true violence, in Stoic terms, is the damage we do
  to our own moral character through vice, not the physical acts we
  traditionally associate with violence. Using examples like murder, I explain
  how Stoicism teaches that no external action can harm another’s virtue, but
  choosing to act unjustly damages our own character. This episode also touches
  on the nuanced relationship between Stoicism, religion, and moral
  decision-making, emphasizing that for Stoics, the measure of uprightness is
  the quality of one’s character, aligned with Nature and the pursuit of virtue.

  "You are doing yourself violence, violence, my soul; and you will have no
  second occasion to do yourself honour. Brief is the life of each of us, and
  this of yours is nearly ended, and yet you do not reverence yourself, but
  commit your well-being to the charge of other men's souls." - Meditations 2.6
