description: "\"Let us cease to desire that which we have been desiring. I, at least, am doing this: in my old age I have ceased to desire what I desired when a boy. To this single end my days and my nights are passed; this is my task, this the object of my thoughts, – to put an end to my chronic ills. I am endeavouring to live every day as if it were a complete life. I do not indeed snatch it up as if it were my last; I do regard it, however, as if it might even be my last.\"\n--\nGet rid of ads and support our work :\_https://link.stoicismpod.com/members\nHang out with us in our free listener community:\_https://link.stoicismpod.com/discord\nJoin our daily Stoic journaling program :\_https://link.stoicismpod.com/journaling\nJoin our Stoic mentoring community :\_https://link.stoicismpod.com/path\_\n--\nView a list of our sponsors :\_https://link.stoicismpod.com/sponsors\n--\nVisit our website :\_https://stoicismpod.com\nCheck out our reading list :\_https://stoicismpod.com/suggested-reading\nRead our articles :\_https://stoicismpod.com/category/articles\n--\nOnline copy of Meditations (Long) :\_https://link.stoicismpod.com/meditations-long\nOnline copy of Meditations (Casaubon) :\_https://link.stoicismpod.com/meditations-casaubon\nOnline copy of Seneca's Letters :\_https://link.stoicismpod.com/letters\n--\nLearn more about your ad choices.
