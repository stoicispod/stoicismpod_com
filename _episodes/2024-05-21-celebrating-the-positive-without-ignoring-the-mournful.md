title: Celebrating The Positive Without Ignoring The Mournful

description: >-
  Good morning, Prokoptôn. In today's episode, I'm responding to a question from
  a Spotify listener named Blarka. The question is about how to think of or
  celebrate a birthday that coincides with the death of a brother or sister.

  This is a thoughtful question with a sad context, but it's an important topic.
  While Stoicism views death as an indifferent in terms of developing Virtue, it
  acknowledges the emotional impact it has on us. It's essential to remember
  that Stoics are allowed to have emotions.

  First, I discuss the Stoic perspective on death. For Stoics, death doesn't
  signify the end of everything. Instead, it's part of a continuous cycle of
  endings and beginnings. The "spark of divine reason" within us doesn't cease
  to exist when our bodies expire.

  Next, I address the specific issue of feeling conflicted when trying to
  celebrate on a day also marked by loss. It's natural to feel this way, but
  it's crucial to examine what our actions on these days say about our
  character. Celebrating and mourning simultaneously doesn't inherently make
  either action inappropriate. The appropriateness of our behavior depends on
  the logic and reasoning behind it.

  In conclusion, I suggest finding a balanced approach to marking the day of a
  great loss. This might involve spending time remembering the lost loved one
  and then allowing yourself to celebrate with friends and family. The key is to
  ensure that your actions align with reasoned and virtuous thinking.

  Thank you for listening, and I hope this discussion provides some intellectual
  value and practical guidance.
