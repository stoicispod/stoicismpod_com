title: 'Free Will: Stop Denying It'

  In this episode, I explore the complex topic of free will, particularly
  through the lens of Stoicism and its modern interpretations. I begin by
  defining free will as our capacity to act, think, or behave in ways that
  aren't predetermined by past events. I delve into Sam Harris's book "Free
  Will," which posits that our brains make decisions before we're consciously
  aware of them, challenging the existence of free will. However, I argue
  against this perspective, suggesting instead that the brain develops cognitive
  shortcuts for decision-making, a concept that aligns with Stoic philosophy.

  I then shift the discussion to the potential dangers of embracing determinism
  or the absence of free will, especially for young people. I express my
  concerns that such beliefs can lead to nihilism and morally dubious actions,
  as they imply our choices are predestined and meaningless. I emphasize the
  importance of upholding the idea of free will to prevent societal and
  character degradation.

  I critique the deterministic view of the ancient Stoics, who believed that
  everything, including our choices, is predestined. I find this view
  contradictory to the essential Stoic principle of making virtuous choices. I
  also discuss and dismiss the concept of 'co-fating' introduced by the ancient
  Stoic philosopher Chrysippus as circular reasoning.

  After a brief pause, I present my theory: fate exists but is suspended in the
  human mind. I argue that while time and inanimate objects are fated, conscious
  beings, particularly humans, can act independently of fate due to their
  concentrated 'logos' or reasoning power. This theory suggests that while the
  universe (fate) moves forward in time, we, as humans, can make independent
  choices.

  In conclusion, I affirm that Stoicism remains a valuable philosophy, albeit
  one that needs to be interpreted in the context of contemporary knowledge and
  science. I propose that practicing Stoicism can foster the development of
  cognitive shortcuts for making virtuous choices, thus aligning our actions
  with nature. I end the episode by reaffirming Stoicism's relevance and
  acknowledging the limitations of ancient Stoic philosophers in grasping
  concepts beyond their scientific understanding.
