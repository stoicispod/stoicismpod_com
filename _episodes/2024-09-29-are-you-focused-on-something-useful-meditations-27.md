title: Are you focused on something useful? (Meditations 2.7)
date: Sun, 29 Sep 2024 14:07:00 -0000
description: >-
  In this episode, I discuss Meditation 7 from Book 2 of Meditations, where
  Marcus Aurelius advises us to give ourselves moments of quiet to focus on
  learning something good, while also warning against aimlessness. I explore how
  modern distractions—whether from media, politics, or content creators—are
  constantly vying for our attention. Marcus’ advice to focus on "something
  good" can be interpreted as learning about virtue, which helps quiet the noise
  of the world. Alternatively, it can mean focusing on something personally
  meaningful, not driven by fear of missing out, but chosen for its value.

  However, Marcus cautions that even when we think we are focusing on something
  good, we must beware of aimlessness. Those who live without broader goals,
  Marcus says, waste their lives in trivial pursuits. I analyze how this warning
  applies to modern content that distorts Stoicism, particularly hyper-masculine
  and red-pill ideologies that mislead young men by portraying women as
  distractions. These misguided ideas lead people to chase false solutions to
  non-existent problems, wasting time and attention.

  The meditation emphasizes that distractions are not external forces, but a
  result of our lack of attention management. A Stoic response is not to
  eliminate external influences, but to strengthen inner resolve and temperance.
  Marcus reminds us that a Stoic should not allow external events, like a
  breakup, to compromise moral character. Instead, the Stoic improves,
  recognizing that virtue is the only true good, and distractions—whether
  relationships or the noise of society—are indifferent unless we let them
  affect us.

  "Do things from outside break in to distract you? Give yourself a time of
  quiet to learn some new good thing and cease to wander out of your course.
  But, when you have done that, be on your guard against a second kind of
  wandering. For those who are sick to death in life, with no mark on which they
  direct every impulse or in general every imagination, are triflers, not in
  words only but also in their deeds." - Meditations 2.7
