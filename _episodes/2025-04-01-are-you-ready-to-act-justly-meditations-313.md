title: Are You Ready to Act Justly? (Meditations 3.13)
date: Tue, 01 Apr 2025 18:46:00 -0000
description: >-
  In this episode, I explore Meditations 3.13, where Marcus Aurelius reminds us
  to keep the principles of Stoicism as close at hand as a doctor keeps their
  instruments. Our “scalpel” is our rational faculty—our ability to discern what
  is right and act justly, even when it's hard. When we stay ready in this way,
  we fulfill our role as rational agents within the whole of Nature.

  We also dig into what it means to be part of a rational and interconnected
  universe. Marcus urges us to treat others justly not because they always
  deserve it, but because we’re bound to one another by a shared nature. Their
  ignorance could have been ours. Their path could have been ours. Recognizing
  this calls us to act with understanding and compassion, grounded always in
  reason.


  MEDITATIONS 3.13

  "As doctors have their instruments and scalpels always at hand to meet sudden
  demands for treatment, so do you have your doctrines ready in order to
  recognize the divine and human... you will not do any act well which concerns
  man without referring it to the divine; and the same is true of your conduct
  to God."


  THREE TAKEAWAYS

  — Keep your principles close: Stoic doctrines should be ready to apply, not
  left to theory.

  — We are all connected: Wrongdoing stems from ignorance, and that demands
  compassion.

  — Acting rationally is our duty: It’s how we honor our place within the whole
  of Nature.
