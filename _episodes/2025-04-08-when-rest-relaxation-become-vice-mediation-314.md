title: When Rest & Relaxation Become Vice (Mediation 3.14)
date: Tue, 08 Apr 2025 07:20:00 -0000
description: >-
  This week, I take a closer look at Meditations 3.14, where Marcus Aurelius
  encourages us not to “wander from our path any longer.” It’s a meditation
  you’ve probably heard before, and while some translations simplify it to “put
  away your books,” I find that framing a little misleading. Books, much like
  hobbies or relaxation activities, have their place. They support our
  well-being and our pursuit of Virtue—when used in the right way.


  In this episode, I unpack what Marcus really means. I talk about how there’s a
  responsible way to interpret the advice against distraction. It’s not about
  abandoning things that bring us joy or rest; it’s about being mindful of
  whether those things serve our ultimate goal of becoming better human beings.
  I use the example of video games to illustrate this balance. Rest is
  essential, and enjoyment isn’t the enemy, but when indulgence turns into
  avoidance, we drift away from our pursuit of Virtue.


  I also explore the differences in translation between Long and Fark, and why I
  prefer Fark’s version here. Fark highlights that it’s not the activity itself
  that’s the issue—it’s the pursuit of recognition, fame, or self-indulgent
  goals that pull us off course.


  The bottom line is this: hobbies and relaxation are fine, even necessary, but
  they must never contend with our pursuit of Virtue. When they do, they stop
  being harmless and become our greatest vices.


  Meditation referenced:

  “Do not wander from your path any longer, for you are not likely to read your
  note-books or your deeds of ancient Rome and Greece or your extracts from
  their writings, which you laid up against old age. Hasten then to the goal,
  lay idle hopes aside, and come to your own help, if you care at all for
  yourself, while still you may.” — Meditations 3.14
