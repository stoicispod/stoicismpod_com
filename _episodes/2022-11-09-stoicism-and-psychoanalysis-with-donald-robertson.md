description: "Today I'm having a friendly discussion with Donald Robertson, author of the book \"How to Think Like a Roman Emperor\" and the new graphic novel \"Verissimus\" (illustrated by talented Portuguese artist Zé Nuno Fraga), about Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis, and all sorts of other things I didn't necessarily expect. Donald was traveling so the audio on his end is a bit poor, but the discussion, I hope, will more than make of up for it.

Today I'm having a friendly discussion with Donald Robertson, author of the book "How to Think Like a Roman Emperor" and the new graphic novel "Verissimus" (illustrated by talented Portuguese artist Zé Nuno Fraga), about Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis, and all sorts of other things I didn't necessarily expect. Donald was traveling so the audio on his end is a bit poor, but the discussion, I hope, will more than make of up for it. Enjoy!
