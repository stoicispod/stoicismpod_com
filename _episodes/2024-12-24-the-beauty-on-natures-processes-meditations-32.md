title: The Beauty on Nature's Processes (Meditations 3.2)

  In this episode, I discuss Meditation 3.2 from Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations.
  This meditation reflects on the inherent beauty in all things that align with
  Nature, even when they might seem imperfect or undesirable to us at first
  glance. Marcus uses examples such as cracks on a freshly baked loaf of bread
  or the ripe, oozing fig to illustrate how side effects of Nature’s processes
  carry their own grace and fascination.

  I explore two key takeaways:

  I. Understanding Natural Processes – By studying and respecting Nature, we
  learn to identify the optimal points in its processes, whether in baking bread
  or recognizing when something has reached its natural conclusion.

  II. Redefining Beauty – Marcus invites us to find beauty not just in the
  outcomes we prefer but in all stages of life’s processes. Even in things like
  a furrowed brow, overripe fruit, or the inevitability of decay, there is a
  harmony with Nature that can inspire respect, wonder, and acceptance.

  Finally, I reflect on how shifting our judgment of ugliness to one of wonder
  and appreciation can deepen our understanding of the world and our place in
  it.

  "We must also observe closely points of this kind, that even the secondary
  effects of Nature's processes possess a sort of grace and attraction. To take
  one instance, bread when it is being baked breaks open at some places; now
  even these cracks, which in one way contradict the promise of the baker's art,
  somehow catch the eye and stimulate in a special way our appetite for the
  food. And again figs, when fully mature, gape, and in ripe olives their very
  approach to decay adds a certain beauty of its own to the fruit. Ears of corn
  too when they bend downwards, the lion's wrinkled brow, the foam flowing from
  the boar's mouth, and many other characteristics that are far from beautiful
  if we look at them in isolation, do nevertheless because they follow from
  Nature's processes lend those a further ornament and a fascination. And so, if
  a man has a feeling for, and a deeper insight into the processes of the
  Universe, there is hardly one but will somehow appear to present itself
  pleasantly to him, even among mere attendant circumstances. Such a man also
  will feel no less pleasure in looking at the actual jaws of wild beasts than
  at the imitations which painters and sculptors exhibit, and he will be enabled
  to see in an old woman or an old man a kind of freshness and bloom, and to
  look upon the charms of his own boy slaves with sober eyes. And many such
  experiences there will be, not convincing to every one but occurring to him
  and to him alone who has become genuinely familiar with Nature and her works."
