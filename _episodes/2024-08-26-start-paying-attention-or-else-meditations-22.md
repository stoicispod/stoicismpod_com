title: Start paying attention, or else (Meditations 2.2)

  In today’s episode, we explore Meditations 2.2 by Marcus Aurelius, diving into
  the Stoic understanding of our bodies, the concept of the “god” in Stoicism,
  and the relationship between our physical body, life-sustaining breath, and
  rational mind. Marcus identifies these three parts of the human being and
  challenges us to take control of the only one we can—the governing self, or
  rational mind.

  We also touch on the Stoic concept of Logos, the naturalistic “god” that
  underpins the universe, and discuss the Stoic perspective on the body as a
  temporary vessel on loan from the universe. Finally, we delve into the
  importance of not letting our minds be controlled by selfish impulses or
  distractions, emphasizing the Stoic practice of paying attention to our
  thoughts and actions as the path to living a virtuous life.

  Meditation Quoted:

  “This whatever it is that I am, is flesh and vital spirit and the governing
  self. Disdain the flesh: blood and bones and network, a twisted skein of
  nerves, veins, arteries. Consider also what the vital spirit is: a current of
  air, not even continuously the same, but every hour being expelled and sucked
  in again. There is then a third part, the governing self. Put away your books,
  be distracted no longer, they are not your portion. Rather, as if on the point
  of death, reflect like this: 'you are an old man, suffer this governing part
  of you no longer to be in bondage, no longer to be a puppet pulled by selfish
  impulse, no longer to be indignant with what is allotted in the present or to
  suspect what is allotted in the future.'” (Meditations, 2.2)
