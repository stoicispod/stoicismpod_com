title: The Self Does Not Exist
date: Tue, 25 Jun 2024 13:04:50 -0000
description: >-
  In this episode, I take a fresh look at Hierocles' Circles of Concern and how
  my understanding of them has evolved. Communicating Stoicism to beginners
  involves striking a balance between simplicity and the depth of the
  philosophy, which can sometimes lead to misunderstandings.

  I address a recent discussion on the /Stoic subreddit that highlighted the
  problem of using complex Stoic terminology without fully understanding it.
  This can create a false sense of authority and perpetuate incorrect
  interpretations of Stoicism. I emphasize that practice is more important than
  book learning and that true Stoicism involves living the philosophy, not just
  knowing the vocabulary.

  I also correct a common misconception about the Circles of Concern. The self
  is not at the center of the concept but is part of a holistic understanding of
  Stoicism. I discuss how focusing on the mind as the starting point is crucial,
  but it does not mean prioritizing oneself over others. Instead, Stoicism
  teaches that all concerns are interconnected and equally important.

  Using the analogy of a snake eating its own tail, I explain how the mind
  initiates and maintains the process of living according to Nature, but is no
  more central than the rest of Nature. This continuous effort is essential to
  achieving Virtue.

  Join me as I clarify these concepts and explore the true meaning of Hierocles'
  Circles of Concern.
