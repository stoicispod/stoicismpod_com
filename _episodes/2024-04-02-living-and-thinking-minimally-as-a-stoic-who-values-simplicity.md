title: Living And Thinking Minimally As A Stoic Who Values Simplicity
date: Tue, 02 Apr 2024 09:00:00 -0000
description: >-
  In today's episode of "Practical Stoicism," I explore the concept of living
  simply, not in the sense of minimalism as it's often portrayed—with a focus on
  physical belongings and a Scandinavian design aesthetic—but in the realm of
  simplifying our thoughts and, by extension, our lives. While Stoicism isn't
  about adopting an aesthetic of minimalism, it does advocate for simplicity
  over complexity in many aspects of life. I delve into how living simply, in a
  Stoic sense, means focusing on what truly matters, reducing unnecessary mental
  clutter that leads to physical clutter. By reflecting on Seneca's admiration
  for Scipio Africanus's modest bathhouse, I illustrate the beauty of simplicity
  and the Stoic pursuit of focusing on essentials. This episode challenges
  contemporary culture's superficial grasp of ancient philosophies and invites
  you to embrace true simplicity by prioritizing virtue and rational choices
  over material excess.
