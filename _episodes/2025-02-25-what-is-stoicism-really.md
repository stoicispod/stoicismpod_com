title: What is Stoicism, really?

description: >-
  Modern interpretations of Stoicism are often wildly inaccurate, reducing the
  philosophy to a life hack for suppressing emotions, a tool for
  productivity-obsessed entrepreneurs, or a justification for toxic masculinity.
  But do any of these portrayals hold up under scrutiny? In this episode, I
  break down these misconceptions by turning to the words of ancient Stoic
  thinkers—Musonius Rufus, Zeno of Citium, and others—who show us that Stoicism
  is far more profound and ethical than pop culture suggests.


  We’ll explore:

  — Why Stoicism is not about indifference but about focusing on what truly
  shapes our character.

  — How both men and women are equally called to pursue Virtue.

  — Why Stoics deeply care about things outside their control, despite the
  common misunderstanding.

  — The true meaning of Stoic emotional management, which is about reasoning
  through emotions rather than repressing them.


  At its core, Stoicism is a philosophy of moral excellence, a commitment to
  aligning ourselves with Nature, and a guide to becoming a force for good in
  the world. Getting Stoicism right matters—not just for personal development,
  but for the influence it has on society as a whole.


  “The goal (of Stoicism) is to live in agreement with nature. For our
  individual natures are parts of the nature of the whole universe.” — Zeno of
  Citium
