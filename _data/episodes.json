    "description": "In this episode, I explore Meditations 3.13, where Marcus Aurelius reminds us to keep the principles of Stoicism as close at hand as a doctor keeps their instruments. Our “scalpel” is our rational faculty—our ability to discern what is right and act justly, even when it's hard. When we stay ready in this way, we fulfill our role as rational agents within the whole of Nature.\nWe also dig into what it means to be part of a rational and interconnected universe. Marcus urges us to treat others justly not because they always deserve it, but because we’re bound to one another by a shared nature. Their ignorance could have been ours. Their path could have been ours. Recognizing this calls us to act with understanding and compassion, grounded always in reason.\n\nMEDITATIONS 3.13\n\"As doctors have their instruments and scalpels always at hand to meet sudden demands for treatment, so do you have your doctrines ready in order to recognize the divine and human... you will not do any act well which concerns man without referring it to the divine; and the same is true of your conduct to God.\"\n\nTHREE TAKEAWAYS\n— Keep your principles close: Stoic doctrines should be ready to apply, not left to theory.\n— We are all connected: Wrongdoing stems from ignorance, and that demands compassion.\n— Acting rationally is our duty: It’s how we honor our place within the whole of Nature.\n\nJoin The Society of Stoics at https://community.stoicismpod.com.

    "title": "Is Inner Peace the Goal of Stoicism? (Meditation 3.12)",
    "date": "Tue, 25 Mar 2025 08:16:00 -0000",
    "description": "In this episode, I walk through Meditations 3.12, where Marcus Aurelius claims that if we pursue Virtue with sincerity and without distraction, we will live “the blessed life.” But what does that really mean in Stoic terms? We examine what “blessed” refers to (spoiler: it’s Eudaimonia, or inner peace) and ask whether the Stoics pursued Virtue for its own sake or for the sake of that peace.\n\nI argue that Virtue leads to inner peace by removing destructive emotions like anger, fear, shame, and grief—what the Stoics called the pathē. When we understand Nature and act in accordance with it, those emotions lose their hold on us. But that inner peace isn’t the goal of Stoicism—it’s a byproduct of doing the work of moral development for its own sake. That work is the point.\n\nMEDITATIONS 3.12\n\n“If you complete the present work, following the rule of right, earnestly, with all your might, with kindness, and admit no side issue, but preserve your own divinity pure and erect, as if you have this moment to restore it; if you make this secure, expecting nothing and avoiding nothing, but content with present action in accord with Nature and with heroic truth in what you mean and say, you will live the blessed life. Now there is no one who is able to prevent this.”\n\nTHREE TAKEAWAYS\n\n— Virtue leads to inner peace: By eliminating destructive emotions through rational understanding, we create a calm mind and a steady heart.\n— The pursuit of Goodness should be its own reward: Stoicism teaches us to seek Virtue not as a means to peace, but as the end in itself.\n— Eudaimonia is a byproduct, not the goal: Inner peace naturally follows from living rightly, but it’s not what we should be aiming at directly.\n\nJoin The Society of Stoics at https://community.stoicismpod.com.

    "title": "Understanding Impressions in Stoicism (Meditations 3.11)",
    "date": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 09:00:00 -0000",
    "description": "In this episode, we explore Meditations 3.11 and its profound insights into how we process and assent to impressions. The Stoics believed that our initial reactions to external events—our impressions—are often flawed, and it’s our responsibility to critically examine them before accepting them as truth. This practice is essential for making rational, virtuous decisions instead of reacting emotionally or impulsively.\n\nMarcus Aurelius reminds us that true greatness comes from methodically and truthfully testing everything we encounter. This means breaking things down into their essential components, considering their role in the larger universe, and determining what virtue is best suited to respond to them. In a world that often prioritizes personal feelings over objective reality, Stoicism challenges us to cultivate reason and clarity.\n\nMEDITATIONS 3.11\n\n“For nothing is so able to create greatness of mind as the power methodically and truthfully to test each thing that meets one in life, and always to look upon it so as to attend at the same time to the use which this particular thing contributes to a Universe of a certain definite kind, what value it has in reference to the Whole, and what to man, who is a citizen of the highest City, whereof all other cities are like households.”\n\nTHREE TAKEAWAYS\n\n— Assenting to impressions requires caution: We should resist the urge to immediately accept our first reactions as truth. Instead, we must analyze the data, break it down, and ensure our conclusions align with reality.\n— Reason must lead our decisions: Emotions are valuable, but they should be informed by rational understanding. A truly great person is one who sees things as they are and allows reason to guide their responses.\n— Withholding assent is not neutrality: Refusing to form an opinion does not mean avoiding bias; it is itself an assent to inaction. Stoicism calls us to engage with reality and make rational, virtuous choices based on the best information available.\n\nJoin The Society of Stoics at https://community.stoicismpod.com.

    "title": "The Illusion of Free Will? (Meditations 3.10)",
    "date": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 10:24:00 -0000",
    "description": "In this episode, I explore Meditations 3.10, where Marcus Aurelius reminds himself—and us—that we only ever live in the present moment. He urges us to remember three things: life is short, the space we occupy is small, and fame is fleeting. But why does he emphasize this? Because knowing who we are and becoming the best version of ourselves is what truly matters.\n\nThis discussion dives into the Stoic understanding of determinism and free will. I explore how our choices shape our character over time, using Chrysippus’ analogy of cones and cylinders to explain how habitual actions determine our future choices. Along the way, I challenge common misunderstandings about fate, examine neuroscientific insights on decision-making, and explain why our focus should be on habituating ourselves toward virtue rather than trying to control the uncontrollable.\n\nMeditations 3.10:\n“Therefore throw all else aside, and hold fast only these few things; further calling to mind at the same time that each of us lives only in the present, this brief moment; the rest is either a life that is past, or is in an uncertain future. Little the life each lives, little the corner of the earth he lives in, little even the longest fame hereafter, and even that dependent on a succession of poor mortals, who will very soon be dead, and have not learnt to know themselves, much less the man who was dead long years ago.”\n\nThree key takeaways from this episode:\n\n— The present moment is the only place where we have power. We cannot change the past, and the future is beyond our control.\n— Habitual choices shape our character. Stoicism teaches us to be intentional about the habits we form because they dictate how we act when we’re not thinking.\n— We cannot control everything, but we can control how we respond. Our role is not to change the world but to become virtuous people who act justly within the world we inhabit.\n\nJoin The Society of Stoics to engage in deeper discussions and support the show: https://community.stoicismpod.com\n\nPurchase a copy of my book: https://stoicismpod.com/book\nRead the source text used: https://stoicismpod.com/far\nFollow me on Bluesky: https://stoicismpod.com/bluesky\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "title": "How Environment Shapes Moral Progress (Meditation 3.9)",
    "date": "Tue, 04 Mar 2025 10:00:00 -0000",
    "description": "This episode explores Meditations 3.9, where Marcus Aurelius urges us to revere our rational faculty. In Stoicism, rationality is our greatest gift—it’s the tool that allows us to pursue Virtue, shape our moral character, and ultimately live in accordance with Nature. But how do we cultivate this faculty, especially when our environment doesn’t support moral growth?\n\nI discuss how we are shaped by our surroundings, often without realizing it. If we’re immersed in Stoic teachings, the path to moral improvement becomes clearer. If we’re surrounded by different influences—religious, ideological, or otherwise—we internalize those instead. This is why the Stoics believed that introducing philosophy too early could be a form of indoctrination rather than genuine moral development.\n\nAs a new father, I reflect on the challenge of raising a child without forcing beliefs upon them. The goal isn’t to dictate what’s right but to create an environment where they can discover Virtue for themselves. The same applies to guiding friends and family—lead by example rather than preaching. For those struggling to commit to moral improvement in a non-Stoic environment, I offer three actionable steps: recognize the need for guidance, seek a mentor, and eventually mentor others when ready.\n\nMarcus Aurelius reminds us that our rational judgment must align with Nature. By shaping our habits and seeking wisdom, we give ourselves the best chance at living a life of Virtue.\n\n“Reverence your faculty of judgement. On this it entirely rests that your governing self no longer has a judgement disobedient to Nature and to the estate of a reasonable being. This judgement promises deliberateness, familiar friendship with our fellow human beings, and to follow in the train of the gods.” — Meditations 3.9\n\nJoin The Society of Stoics, my private community for those committed to Stoic practice.

    "title": "What is Stoicism, really?",
    "date": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 10:00:00 -0000",
    "description": "Modern interpretations of Stoicism are often wildly inaccurate, reducing the philosophy to a life hack for suppressing emotions, a tool for productivity-obsessed entrepreneurs, or a justification for toxic masculinity. But do any of these portrayals hold up under scrutiny? In this episode, I break down these misconceptions by turning to the words of ancient Stoic thinkers—Musonius Rufus, Zeno of Citium, and others—who show us that Stoicism is far more profound and ethical than pop culture suggests.\n\nWe’ll explore:\n— Why Stoicism is not about indifference but about focusing on what truly shapes our character.\n— How both men and women are equally called to pursue Virtue.\n— Why Stoics deeply care about things outside their control, despite the common misunderstanding.\n— The true meaning of Stoic emotional management, which is about reasoning through emotions rather than repressing them.\n\nAt its core, Stoicism is a philosophy of moral excellence, a commitment to aligning ourselves with Nature, and a guide to becoming a force for good in the world. Getting Stoicism right matters—not just for personal development, but for the influence it has on society as a whole.\n\n“The goal (of Stoicism) is to live in agreement with nature. For our individual natures are parts of the nature of the whole universe.” — Zeno of Citium\n\nJoin the Practical Stoicism community, the Society of Stoics, at https://community.stoicismpod.com.

    "title": "Why Stoicism Teaches Us to Be Prepared for Death (Meditations 3.8)",
    "date": "Tue, 18 Feb 2025 10:00:00 -0000",
    "description": "In this episode, I explore Meditations 3.8 and the idea of preparing for death—not as a morbid fascination, but as a necessary step toward living justly and without fear. Marcus Aurelius describes the Stoic sage as someone unshaken by fate, someone who meets the end of life without hesitation or regret. But how does this apply to the rest of us, who are still progressing in our practice?\n\n“In the understanding of a man of chastened and purified spirit you will find, no trace of festering wound, no ulceration, no abscess beneath the skin. The hour of fate does not surprise his life before its fulfilment, so that one would say that the actor is leaving the stage before he has fulfilled his role, before the play is over. You will find nothing servile or artificial, no dependence on others nor severance from them; nothing to account for, nothing that needs a hole to hide in.” -- Meditations 3.8\n\nA core theme in this meditation is the relationship between fear and duty. If we allow fear—whether of death, judgment, or hardship—to dictate our choices, we risk abandoning our roles and responsibilities. Through a firefighter analogy, I break down how Stoicism teaches us to act justly by focusing on our roles rather than potential consequences. The takeaway? True Stoic practice isn’t about becoming fearless but about ensuring that fear never prevents us from acting in alignment with Virtue.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n\t•\tMarcus Aurelius is speaking about the Stoic sage, not the Prokoptôn.\n\t•\tFear of death impairs our ability to act justly and fulfill our roles.\n\t•\tStoicism does not glorify suffering—it values resilience and moral clarity.\n\t•\tStoics are not indifferent to life, but they recognize it as an indifferent in the pursuit of Virtue.\n\t•\tThe ancient Stoics believed sagehood was theoretically possible, but practically, it remains an unreachable ideal.\n\nUltimately, this meditation reminds us that shedding fear—especially fear of death—frees us to serve others and pursue Virtue without hesitation.\n\nJoin The Society of Stoics\n\nWant to deepen your understanding of Stoicism in a private community?

    "date": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 10:00:00 -0000",
    "description": "In this episode, I explore Meditations 3.7, where Marcus Aurelius reminds us that nothing should take priority over Virtue. Many misunderstand Stoicism as a philosophy of detachment, resilience, and isolation, but in truth, it is profoundly prosocial. Being a Stoic means fulfilling our roles within the broader human community, not retreating from it. I challenge the popular but misguided idea of Stoicism as a philosophy for lone survivalists, demonstrating how its core teachings—from Zeno to Epictetus to Seneca—emphasize duty, justice, and engagement with the world. True Stoicism isn’t about turning inward; it’s about striving for moral excellence in every interaction.\n\n“Never value as an advantage to yourself what will force you one day to break your word, to abandon self-respect, to hate, suspect, execrate another, to act a part, to covet anything that calls for walls or coverings to conceal it. A man who puts first his own mind and divinity, and the holy rites of its excellence, makes no scene, utters no groans, will need neither the refuge of solitude nor the crowded streets. What is most worthwhile, he will pass his days neither in pursuit nor in avoidance, and it is no concern at all of his whether the time be longer or shorter for which he shall have the use of the soul in its bodily envelope; for even if he must be released at once, he will depart as easily as he would perform any other act that can be done with reverence and sobriety, being careful all his life of this one thing alone: that his understanding be not found in any state which is foreign to a reasonable social being.” --(Meditations 3.7)\n\nTAKEAWAYS\n\n— The highest priority in Stoicism is the pursuit of Virtue—nothing should stand in its way.\n— Stoicism is not a philosophy of detachment or isolation but of prosocial engagement and duty.\n— A Stoic does not seek solitude or approval; they act justly regardless of external validation.\n\nLINKS\n\n— Get on the list: https://stoicismpod.com/list\n— Go ad-free: https://stoicismpod.com/members\n— Order my book: https://stoicismpod.com/book\n— Source Text: https://stoicismpod.com/far\n— Follow me on BlueSky: https://bsky.app/profile/tannerocampbell.bsky.social\n— Follow me on YouTube: https://stoicismpod.com/youtube\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "description": "In this episode, I explore Meditations 3.6 and the challenge Marcus Aurelius presents to those seeking the Good life: is there anything higher than justice, truth, temperance, and fortitude? If we find something greater, we should pursue it wholeheartedly. But if not, then we must commit ourselves fully to Virtue. I also address the common misconception that Stoicism promotes emotional repression or toxic perfectionism. True Stoicism is about disciplined reasoning, self-improvement, and moral alignment—not detachment or indifference. If the pursuit of Virtue is the highest aim, then what could be better than dedicating our lives to it?\n\n“If you discover in the life of man something higher than justice, truth, temperance, fortitude, and generally speaking than your understanding contented with itself, where it presents you behaving by the rule of right, and satisfied with destiny, in what is assigned to you and is not yours to choose; if, I say, you see something higher than this, turn to it with all your heart and enjoy the supreme good now that it is found…” - Meditations 3.6\n\nTAKEAWAYS\n+ The highest good in Stoicism is the pursuit of Virtue—nothing else surpasses it.\n+ True Stoicism is not about emotional repression but about disciplined reasoning and moral alignment.\n+ The pursuit of an ideal, even if unattainable, is valuable in itself and fuels lifelong self-improvement.\n\nLINKS\n— Go ad-free: https://stoicismpod.com/members\n— Follow the print publication: https://stoicismpod.com/print\n— Take my free courses: https://stoicismpod.com/courses\n— Order my book: https://stoicismpod.com/book\n— Source Text: https://stoicismpod.com/far\n— Follow me on BlueSky: https://stoicismpod.com/bluesky\n— Follow me on YouTube: https://stoicismpod.com/youtube\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "description": "In this episode, Tanner explores Meditations 3.5 by Marcus Aurelius, diving into its core teachings about Stoic ethics and virtuous living. The meditation emphasizes acting with integrity, examining one’s motives, and focusing on moral reasoning rather than outcomes. Tanner reflects on Marcus’s invocation of the “God within” as a call to internalize virtue and gratitude, encouraging listeners to appreciate life, even during adversity. The discussion underscores the Stoic principle of striving for progress rather than perfection, illustrating how even imperfect circumstances can foster growth.\n\nMEDITATION TEXT\n\n“Do not act unwillingly nor selfishly nor without self-examination, nor with divergent motives. Let no affectation veneer your thinking. Be neither a busy talker, nor a busybody. Moreover let the God within be the guardian of a real man, a man of ripe years, a statesman, a Roman, a magistrate, who has taken his post like one waiting for the Retreat to sound, ready to depart, needing no oath nor any man as witness. And see that you have gladness of face, no need of service from without nor the peace that other men bestow. You should stand upright, not be held upright.” (Meditations 3.5)\n\nTAKEAWAYS\n\n— Stoics should act justly and logically, focusing on their motives rather than outcomes.\n— Virtue is accessible to anyone who earnestly pursues it, regardless of background.\n— Life’s challenges are fleeting opportunities to grow in gratitude and work toward Virtue.\n\nLINKS\n\n— Go ad-free: https://stoicismpod.com/members\n— Join the Discord Community: https://stoicismpod.com/discord\n— Follow the print publication: https://stoicismpod.com/print\n— Take my free courses: https://stoicismpod.com/courses\n— Order my book: https://stoicismpod.com/book\n— Source Text: https://stoicismpod.com/far\n— Follow me on BlueSky: https://bsky.app/profile/tannerocampbell.bsky.social\n— Follow me on YouTube: https://stoicismpod.com/youtube\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "description": "In this episode, Tanner answers a listener question from Wyatt Bennett: “What does Stoicism say about human nature? Are humans naturally selfish?” Exploring this through the Stoic concept of Oikeiôsis and the Circles of Concern, Tanner explains how our understanding of responsibilities expands as we mature. Starting from self-concern in infancy, we grow to care for family, friends, community, humanity, and even the planet. Tanner challenges Thomas Hobbes’ pessimistic view of human nature, offering a Stoic perspective that emphasizes the dynamic and evolving nature of human rationality and moral growth.\n\nTAKEAWAYS\n\n\nStoicism sees human nature as dynamic, with our rational and moral concerns expanding over time.\n\nSelf-concern in early life is natural but not permanent; growth involves widening our circles of responsibility.\n\nNature’s alignment isn’t always pleasurable for individuals but serves a greater universal purpose.\n\n\nLINKS\n\nGo ad-free: https://stoicismpod.com/members\nJoin the Discord Community: https://stoicismpod.com/discord\nFollow the print publication: https://stoicismpod.com/print\nTake my free courses: https://stoicismpod.com/courses\nOrder my book: https://stoicismpod.com/book\nSource Text: https://stoicismpod.com/far\nFollow me on BlueSky: https://bsky.app/profile/tannerocampbell.bsky.social\nFollow me on YouTube: https://stoicismpod.com/youtube\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Marcus warns against wasting time on unnecessary concerns about others, emphasizing opportunity cost and the importance of focusing on appropriate external and internal matters. Tanner also discusses the practice of habituating virtuous thoughts—those we would not be ashamed to express openly—as a step toward moral excellence. The meditation highlights the innate rationality within us, gifted by the Logos, and reminds us that our purpose is to act in alignment with justice and reason. Finally, Marcus advises caution in choosing whose counsel to value, urging Stoics to avoid being swayed by those who do not pursue Virtue themselves.\n\nMEDITATION TEXT\n\n“Do not waste the balance of life left to you in thoughts about other persons, when you are not referring to some advantage of your fellows—for why do you rob yourself of something else which you might do—I mean if you imagine to yourself what so and so is doing, and why; what he is saying or thinking or planning, and every thought of the kind which leads you astray from close watch over your governing self?

    "title": "Death and the Choice to Live Wisely (Meditations 3.3)",
    "date": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 08:56:00 -0000",
    "description": "In this episode, I reflect on Meditation 3.3 from Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations, exploring its central themes: the inevitability of death, the futility of fearing it, and the Stoic imperative to live well while we can. Marcus reminds us that even the most accomplished and revered figures—be they healers, conquerors, or philosophers—ultimately succumb to mortality. Their stories serve as a humbling reminder of our shared fate and an encouragement to prioritize virtue over fame, power, or fear.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n\n\nMortality as a Universal Truth: From Hippocrates, the renowned healer, to Alexander the Great, a world conqueror, and even pre-Socratic philosophers like Heraclitus and Democritus, death claims everyone regardless of their accomplishments, intellect, or virtue.\n\n\nThe Two Reasons to Remember Mortality: (1) It motivates us to cherish the time we have and use it wisely, both for personal growth and to nurture meaningful relationships. (2) It grounds us in the natural order, reminding us that we are part of Nature and subject to its laws.\n\n\nWhy Immortality Isn’t the Goal: The aim of life isn’t to avoid death but to live virtuously. A good life is defined by our choices and actions in the present, not by the number of years we accumulate.\n\n\nMarcus’ Reassurance About Death: Marcus suggests that death leads to one of two outcomes: either we transition to another life governed by reason, or we enter a state of eternal rest free from pain and struggle. Both are nothing to fear.\n\n\nLiving in Accord with Nature: Death, like all aspects of life, is part of the rational order of the Cosmos. By accepting it as natural, we can focus on fulfilling our purpose—striving for virtue and contributing to the Cosmopolis.\n\n\n“Hippocrates, after curing many sicknesses, himself fell sick and died. The Chaldean astrologers foretold the death of many persons, then the hour of fate overtook them also. Alexander, Pompeius, and Julius Caesar, after so often utterly destroying whole towns and slaying in the field many myriads of horse and foot, themselves also one day departed from life. Heraclitus, after many speculations about the fire which should consume the Universe, was waterlogged by dropsy, poulticed himself with cow-dung and died. Vermin killed Democritus; another kind of vermin Socrates. What is the moral? You went on board, you set sail, you have made the port. Step ashore: if to a second life, nothing is void of gods, not even in that other world; but if to unconsciousness, you will cease to suffer pains and pleasures and to be the servant of an earthly vessel as far inferior as that which does it service is superior; for the one is mind and deity, the other clay and gore.” - Meditations 3.3\n\n--\n\nGo ad-free : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nJoin the Discord Community : https://stoicismpod.com/discord\nFollow the print publication : https://stoicismpod.com/print\nTake my free courses : https://stoicismpod.com/courses\nOrder my book : https://stoicismpod.com/book\nSource Text : https://stoicismpod.com/far\nFollow me on BlueSky: https://bsky.app/profile/tannerocampbell.bsky.social\nFollow me on YouTube: https://youtube.com/@stoicismpod\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "date": "Tue, 24 Dec 2024 10:00:00 -0000",
    "description": "In this episode, I discuss Meditation 3.2 from Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations. This meditation reflects on the inherent beauty in all things that align with Nature, even when they might seem imperfect or undesirable to us at first glance. Marcus uses examples such as cracks on a freshly baked loaf of bread or the ripe, oozing fig to illustrate how side effects of Nature’s processes carry their own grace and fascination.\nI explore two key takeaways:\nI. Understanding Natural Processes – By studying and respecting Nature, we learn to identify the optimal points in its processes, whether in baking bread or recognizing when something has reached its natural conclusion.\nII. Redefining Beauty – Marcus invites us to find beauty not just in the outcomes we prefer but in all stages of life’s processes. Even in things like a furrowed brow, overripe fruit, or the inevitability of decay, there is a harmony with Nature that can inspire respect, wonder, and acceptance.\nFinally, I reflect on how shifting our judgment of ugliness to one of wonder and appreciation can deepen our understanding of the world and our place in it.\n\"We must also observe closely points of this kind, that even the secondary effects of Nature's processes possess a sort of grace and attraction. To take one instance, bread when it is being baked breaks open at some places; now even these cracks, which in one way contradict the promise of the baker's art, somehow catch the eye and stimulate in a special way our appetite for the food. And again figs, when fully mature, gape, and in ripe olives their very approach to decay adds a certain beauty of its own to the fruit. Ears of corn too when they bend downwards, the lion's wrinkled brow, the foam flowing from the boar's mouth, and many other characteristics that are far from beautiful if we look at them in isolation, do nevertheless because they follow from Nature's processes lend those a further ornament and a fascination. And so, if a man has a feeling for, and a deeper insight into the processes of the Universe, there is hardly one but will somehow appear to present itself pleasantly to him, even among mere attendant circumstances. Such a man also will feel no less pleasure in looking at the actual jaws of wild beasts than at the imitations which painters and sculptors exhibit, and he will be enabled to see in an old woman or an old man a kind of freshness and bloom, and to look upon the charms of his own boy slaves with sober eyes. And many such experiences there will be, not convincing to every one but occurring to him and to him alone who has become genuinely familiar with Nature and her works.\" – Meditations 3.2\n--\nGo ad-free : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nJoin the Discord Community : https://stoicismpod.com/discord\nFollow the print publication : https://stoicismpod.com/print\nTake my free courses : https://stoicismpod.com/courses\nOrder my book : https://stoicismpod.com/book\nSource Text : https://stoicismpod.com/far\nFollow me on BlueSky: https://bsky.app/profile/tannerocampbell.bsky.social\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "date": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 10:00:00 -0000",
    "description": "Today we begin Book 3 of Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. Meditation 3.1 reminds us that our time is limited—not just by death, but by the potential loss of our rational faculty as we age. Marcus writes that even if life continues, our ability to reason, comprehend, and adapt to events may diminish. He urges us to press forward with our pursuit of Virtue while we still have the capacity to live thoughtfully and intentionally.\nMemento Mori—the practice of remembering our mortality—grounds Stoic practice, but Marcus reminds us that it is not a lifehack to achieve personal goals or ambitions. Instead, it’s a practice rooted in the Stoic commitment to living in alignment with Nature and contributing to the greater good of the Cosmopolis. This meditation challenges us to reflect on how we use the present moment, which is the only time truly within our power, to make progress toward Virtue.\n\"We ought to take into account not only the fact that day by day life is being spent and a smaller balance remaining, but this further point also that, should we live longer, it is at least doubtful whether the intellect will hereafter be the same.\" - Meditations 3.1\n--\nGo ad-free : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nJoin the Discord Community : https://stoicismpod.com/discord\nFollow the print publication : https://stoicismpod.com/print\nTake my free courses : https://stoicismpod.com/courses\nOrder my book : https://stoicismpod.com/book\nSource Text : https://stoicismpod.com/far\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "title": "Why Philosophy Is the Only True Guide Through Life (Meditations 2.17)",
    "date": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 10:00:00 -0000",
    "description": "In this episode, I discuss Meditation 17 from Book 2 of Meditations, where Marcus Aurelius reflects on the transient and uncertain nature of life. Marcus reminds us that our lives are brief and unpredictable, with the physical and spiritual aspects of existence constantly in flux. In the face of this, Marcus asserts that only Philosophy can serve as our guide through life, providing us with the means to keep our spirit unharmed, act with purpose, and accept the inevitable changes and dissolution of Nature without fear.\nMarcus highlights the importance of focusing on the present moment, the only time we truly have control over. While the past can inform our decisions, and the future must be considered for virtuous planning, neither should overwhelm the present. By living according to a guiding philosophy—one that emphasizes virtue, rationality, and alignment with Nature—we ensure that our choices lead us closer to the Good. I also explore how adopting a coherent and virtuous philosophy, like Stoicism, helps us frame our actions and emotions, avoiding the pitfalls of nihilism or harmful ideologies.\n\"Of man's life, his time is a point, his existence a flux, his sensation clouded, his body's entire composition corruptible, his vital spirit an eddy of breath, his fortune hard to predict, his fame uncertain. Briefly, all the things of the body, a river; all the things of the spirit, dream and delirium; his life a warfare and a sojourn in a strange land, his after-fame oblivion. What then can be his escort through life? One thing and one thing only, Philosophy. And this is to keep the spirit within him unwronged and unscathed, master of pains and pleasures, doing nothing at random, nothing falsely and with pretence; needing no other to do aught or to leave aught undone; and moreover accepting what befalls it, that is, what is assigned to it, as coming from that other world from which it came itself. And in all things awaiting death, with a mind that is satisfied, counting it nothing else than a release of the elements from which each living creature is composed. Now if there is no hurt to the elements themselves in their ceaseless changing each into other, why should a man apprehend anxiously the change and dissolution of them all? For this is according to Nature; and no evil is according to Nature.\" - Meditations 2.17\n--\nGo ad-free : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nJoin the Discord Community : https://stoicismpod.com/discord\nFollow the print publication : https://stoicismpod.com/print\nTake my free courses : https://stoicismpod.com/courses\nOrder my book : https://stoicismpod.com/book\nSource Text : https://stoicismpod.com/far\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "title": "Five Ways to Damage the Soul (Meditations 2.16)",
    "date": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 04:35:00 -0000",
    "description": "In this episode, I examine Meditation 16 from Book 2 of Meditations, where Marcus Aurelius reflects on the ways in which a person’s soul—or daemon, in Stoic terminology—can harm itself. Marcus lists five key actions that damage the soul, emphasizing that such harm occurs when we act contrary to Nature and our rational purpose.\nThe first way we harm ourselves is by separating from Nature, acting as though we are independent of the Universe’s interconnected system. The second is by turning against others with the intent to harm, which undermines our duty to cooperate within the Cosmopolis. Third, we damage ourselves when we allow pleasure or pain to control our actions, forsaking rational decision-making for hedonism or avoidance. Fourth, we harm our character by engaging in lies or fostering illusions, as these actions habituate vice. Finally, we cause harm when we act without purpose, neglecting our roles and responsibilities within society.\nMarcus reminds us that living in alignment with Nature requires continuous effort and self-reflection. This meditation highlights the Stoic commitment to personal accountability and the importance of cultivating a virtuous character.\n\"The soul of a man does violence to itself, first and foremost when it becomes so far as in it lies, a separate growth, a blain as it were upon the Universe. For to turn against anything that comes to pass is a separation from Nature, by which the natures of each of the rest are severally comprehended. Secondly, when it turns away from any human being or is swept counter to him, meaning to injure him, as is the case with the natures of those who are enraged. It violates itself, thirdly, when it is the victim of pleasure or pain; fourthly, when it acts apart, and says or does anything both feignedly and falsely. Fifthly, when, failing to direct any act or impulse of its own upon a mark, it behaves in any matter without a plan or conscious purpose, whereas even the smallest act ought to have a reference to the end. Now the end of reasonable creatures is this: to obey the rule and ordinance of the most venerable of all cities and governments.\" - Meditations 2.16\n--\nGo ad-fee for life : https://stoicismpod.com/lifer\nGet a free signed copy of my book : https://giveaway.whatisstoicismbook.com\nJoin the Discord : https://stoicismpod.com/discord\nFollow the print publication : https://stoicismpod.com/print\nTake the free course : https://understandingstoicism.com\nOrder my book : https://stoicismpod.com/book\nSource Text : https://stoicismpod.com/far\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "date": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:45:22 -0000",
    "description": "In this episode, I reflect on Meditation 15 from Book 2 of Meditations, where Marcus Aurelius emphasizes that “all is opinion.” This principle, shared by the Cynic philosopher Monimus, suggests that our perception defines our reality. While this concept is intuitive, its true power lies in recognizing the control we have over how we frame our experiences. By adjusting our perceptions, we can transform how we respond to life’s challenges, even in situations of profound loss or injustice.\nI explore how framing can help us endure grief, such as the death of a loved one, whether it occurs naturally or through tragic circumstances like a murder. While emotional responses are natural, Marcus reminds us that we always have the power to choose how we think about such events. Viewing loss as part of Nature’s causal chain rather than as an unfair tragedy helps us avoid bitterness and remain aligned with virtue. This ability to reframe events extends beyond personal loss, shaping how we navigate disagreements, relationships, and our roles within the Cosmopolis.\n\"Remember that all is opinion. For what was said by the Cynic Monimus is manifest: and manifest too is the use of what was said, if a man receives what may be got out of it as far as it is true.\" - Meditations 2.15\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "date": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 07:02:02 -0000",
    "description": "In this episode, I examine Meditation 14 from Book 2 of Meditations, where Marcus Aurelius reflects on the nature of time and the present moment. Marcus emphasizes that we cannot lose the past, as it no longer exists, nor the future, as it has yet to arrive. The only thing we can truly lose is the present moment, which is fleeting and finite. He reminds us that regardless of the length of one’s life, everyone loses the same thing in death: the ability to exist in the present.\nThis meditation encourages us to focus on the now without disregarding our responsibilities to others and the Cosmopolis. While the present moment is the only time we can act, we must also consider the impact of our actions on the future. A Stoic life involves planning and considering our role in society, rather than becoming isolated or overly focused on personal resilience. Marcus’ reflections also critique the tendency to reduce Stoicism to simplistic, individualistic ideas that ignore its foundational emphasis on service and community.\n\"Even were you about to live three thousand years or thrice ten thousand, nevertheless remember this, that no one loses any other life than this which he is living, nor lives any other than this which he is losing. Thus the longest and the shortest come to the same thing. For the present is equal for all, and what is passing is therefore equal: thus what is being lost is proved to be barely a moment. For a man could lose neither past nor future; how can one rob him of what he has not got? Always remember, then, these two things: one, that all things from everlasting are of the same kind, and are in rotation; and it matters nothing whether it be for a hundred years or for two hundred or for an infinite time that a man shall behold the same spectacle; the other, that the longest-lived and the soonest to die have an equal loss; for it is the present alone of which either will be deprived, since (as we saw) this is all he has and a man does not lose what he has not got.\" - Meditations 2.14\n--\nGo ad-free : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nFollow the print publication : https://stoicismpod.com/print\nTake the free course : https://understandingstoicism.com\nOrder my book : https://stoicismpod.com/book\nSource Text : https://stoicismpod.com/far\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "date": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 13:21:00 -0000",
    "description": "In this episode, I review Meditation 13 from Book 2 of Meditations, where Marcus Aurelius reflects on the futility of constantly seeking to understand or judge others instead of focusing on our own alignment with Nature. Marcus references Pindar to illustrate how some people waste their lives in endless speculation, failing to see that true fulfillment comes from connecting with the divine reason, or “Daimon,” within each of us. This Daimon represents our inner sense of virtue and alignment with Nature, not an external god. Marcus reminds us that serving this inner divinity means keeping it unsullied by petty concerns, resentment, or trivial worries.\nThe meditation also addresses the judgment of others, encouraging us to consider the quality of those whose approval we seek. Are they motivated by virtue, or are they driven by shallow pursuits? Marcus believes that when people misunderstand or act against Nature, it is not due to inherent evil but rather ignorance of what is truly good. This ignorance is like a blindness, a disability more severe than the inability to distinguish light from dark. To the Stoics, all vice stems from a lack of understanding, and nothing is worse than living in ignorance of Nature’s moral law.\n\"Nothing is more wretched than the man who goes round and round everything, and, as Pindar says, 'searches the bowels of the earth,' and seeks by conjecture to sound the minds of his neighbours, but fails to perceive that it is enough to abide with the Divinity that is within himself and to do Him genuine service. Now that service is to keep Him unsullied by passion, trifling, and discontent with what comes from God or men. What comes from the Gods is to be revered because of excellence; what comes from men is dear because they are of one kindred with himself; pitiful too sometimes, humanly speaking, by reason of their ignorance of good and ill. This disablement is more grievous than that which robs the eyes of the power to distinguish light from darkness.\" - Meditations 2.13\n--\nInterested in a London event?

    "title": "Accepting Mortality: Marcus Aurelius on the Purpose of Death (Meditations 2.12)",
    "date": "Tue, 05 Nov 2024 10:23:09 -0000",
    "description": "In this episode, I discuss Meditation 12 from Book 2 of Meditations, where Marcus Aurelius reflects on the transient nature of life, death, and the things we often fear or desire. Marcus emphasizes that everything in the Universe is impermanent, including our bodies, desires, and even the monuments we create. These fleeting aspects of life, he suggests, should be seen as trivial or “cheap” when compared to the pursuit of virtue.\nMarcus also contemplates death, framing it not as something to be feared but as a natural and necessary part of the Universe’s self-sustaining design. Death is not just Nature’s handiwork; it is her well-being—a crucial component in maintaining balance. By accepting death as a fundamental part of the Cosmos, we can shift our focus from fearing mortality to embracing a life aligned with our values. Marcus further encourages us to consider who we look to for praise and honor, questioning whether their judgments align with virtue or merely societal vanity.\nIn Stoic philosophy, the true aim of life is not to evade death but to live justly and virtuously. By understanding death as a natural phenomenon, we can resist the urge to abandon our values out of fear. Instead, we stand firm in the pursuit of a life that honors virtue, regardless of life’s brevity.\n\"How all things are vanishing swiftly, bodies themselves in the Universe and the memorials of them in Time; what is the character of all the things of sense, and most of all those which attract by the bait of pleasure or terrify by the threat of pain or are shouted abroad by vanity, how cheap, contemptible, soiled, corruptible, and mortal:—these are for the faculty of mind to consider. To consider too what kind of men those are whose judgements and voices confer honour and dishonour; what it is to die, and that if a man looks at it by itself and by the separating activity of thought strips off all the images associated with death, he will come to judge it to be nothing else but Nature's handiwork. But if a man fears Nature's handiwork he is a mere child; and yet death is not merely Nature's handiwork, but also her well-being. To consider also how mortal man touches God and through what organ of himself, and when that part of him is in what sort of condition.\" - Meditations 2.12\n--\nGo ad-free : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nFollow the print publication : https://stoicismpod.com/print\nTake the free course : https://understandingstoicism.com\nOrder my book : https://stoicismpod.com/book\nSource Text : https://stoicismpod.com/far\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "date": "Mon, 28 Oct 2024 09:00:00 -0000",
    "description": "In this episode, I discuss Meditation 11 from Book 2 of Meditations, where Marcus Aurelius reminds us to live each moment as if death could come at any time, encouraging a focus on living virtuously. Marcus addresses the nature of death and the existence of gods, framing them in a way that reduces fear. He explains that if gods exist, they are just, so there is no need to fear death. If gods do not exist, then life has no divine meaning, and death is a natural peace. Marcus implies that life is purposeful and that the Cosmos supports virtuous living, so we should focus on actions aligned with our goals and moral growth.\nI explore how this perspective allows Stoics to view life’s challenges, including the existence of evil, with less distress. Marcus frames “evil” as ignorance and vice, and by trusting in the rationality of the Cosmos, we believe that every challenge has a virtuous counter. This mindset helps us avoid responding to darkness with darkness. Instead, by seeing every obstacle as an opportunity to act rightly, we resist the urge to adopt negativity in response to life’s hardships. This focus on virtuous action enables us to maintain a Stoic purpose, finding strength in aligning our actions with reason and justice.\n\"In the conviction that it is possible you may depart from life at once, act and speak and think in every case accordingly.

    "date": "Mon, 21 Oct 2024 09:00:00 -0000",
    "description": "In this episode, I cover Meditation 10 from Book 2 of Meditations, where Marcus Aurelius reflects on the comparison between faults driven by anger and those driven by desire. He references Theophrastus, who argued that errors rooted in pleasure and appetite are graver than those caused by anger. I explore this idea, explaining how Stoics view actions driven by desire as more deliberate and habituated than those caused by reactive emotions like anger. When we act out of anger, it is often a response to external stimuli, a proto-emotion that we can manage. However, when driven by pleasure, it is a deeper habituation that reflects ongoing indulgence in vice, making it harder to correct.\nI also discuss the translation issues around the term \"effeminate,\" which appears in some versions of this meditation. I explain how the term used in Greek more accurately means \"morally weak\" rather than a critique of femininity. Marcus’ message is not about gender but about the danger of succumbing to our desires without rational consideration, a habit that can lead to greater moral failings over time.\nThe episode further delves into the concept of habituation as a critical Stoic tool. I emphasize that Stoicism is not just a philosophy but a practice that requires repeated, deliberate actions. Through consistent practice, our responses to situations become reflexive, turning virtuous behavior into a habit. This is why true Stoic progress involves moving beyond conscious effort to a stage where virtue becomes second nature, a goal that even I am still striving to achieve.\n\"Like a true philosopher Theophrastus says, when comparing, as men commonly do compare, various faults, errors of appetite are graver than errors of temper. For clearly one who loses his temper is turning away from Reason with a kind of pain and inward spasm; whereas he who offends through appetite is the victim of pleasure and is clearly more vicious in a way and more effeminate in his wrong-doing.\" - Meditations 2.10\n--\nGo ad-free : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nFollow the print publication : https://stoicismpod.com/print\nTake the free course : https://understandingstoicism.com\nOrder my book : https://stoicismpod.com/book\nSource Text : https://stoicismpod.com/far\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "date": "Tue, 15 Oct 2024 09:26:00 -0000",
    "description": "In this episode, I reflect on Meditation 9 from Book 2 of Meditations. Marcus Aurelius reminds us to always remember the nature of the Cosmos and our place within it. He emphasizes that the Cosmos is a rational and self-sustaining system, and as part of it, we share in that logic and beneficence. Marcus urges us to act in accordance with Nature, meaning that we should strive to be rational and beneficent, just as the Cosmos is.\nI explore how the Cosmos, though not consciously acting like a human, sustains itself in a way that allows everything within it to exist and perform its roles. By understanding this, we realize that no external force can prevent us from making choices in line with our rational nature. While external circumstances may influence us, it is ultimately our choice how we respond to them. Marcus reminds us that it is not the external situation, but how we make choices, that determines whether we act with wisdom and virtue.\nI also touch on the Stoic concept of personal responsibility, explaining how we are always accountable for our choices. Even when provoked, such as by an unkind boss, it is our choice how we react, and only we can choose to act with virtue or vice. The key is not just in the choice itself, but in the reasoning behind that choice. By internalizing the understanding that we are in control of our responses, we can aim to align ourselves with the rational and beneficent nature of the Cosmos.\n\"Always remember the following: what the nature of the Whole is; what my own nature is; the relation of this nature to that; what kind of part it is of what kind of Whole; and that no man can hinder your saying and doing at all times what is in accordance with that Nature whereof you are a part.\" - Meditations 2.9\n--\nGo ad-free : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nFollow the print publication : https://stoicismpod.com/print\nTake the free course : https://understandingstoicism.com\nOrder my book : https://stoicismpod.com/book\nSource Text : https://stoicismpod.com/far\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "description": "In this episode, I discuss Meditation 8 from Book 2 of Meditations. Marcus Aurelius reflects on how people rarely suffer from not understanding the thoughts of others but are bound to suffer if they don’t observe their own thoughts. I explain how spending too much time worrying about what others think leaves us no energy to examine our own thoughts and work toward virtue. This meditation is not about ignoring others, but rather about prioritizing our mental energy wisely. We can care for others, but we must avoid wasting time on trivial judgments about why someone acts a certain way or holds an opinion about us.\nI tie this to a broader Stoic understanding of how most people are \"sick\" with ignorance, often chasing material desires or misconceptions about what is good. This lack of understanding causes people to live in private worlds of delusion, where their judgments are skewed by false perceptions. Stoicism, on the other hand, teaches that the only true good is virtue, and once we embrace that understanding, we gain clarity on how lost most people are. By focusing on our own character and its alignment with virtue, we avoid the misery that comes from spending too much time concerned with the faults of others.\n\"Men are not easily seen to be brought into evil case by failure to consider what passes in another's soul; but they who do not read aright the motions of their own soul are bound to be in evil case.\" - Meditations 2.8\n--\nGo ad-free : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nFollow the print publication : https://stoicismpod.com/print\nTake the free course : https://understandingstoicism.com\nOrder my book : https://stoicismpod.com/book\nSource Text : https://stoicismpod.com/far\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "date": "Sun, 29 Sep 2024 14:07:00 -0000",
    "description": "In this episode, I discuss Meditation 7 from Book 2 of Meditations, where Marcus Aurelius advises us to give ourselves moments of quiet to focus on learning something good, while also warning against aimlessness. I explore how modern distractions—whether from media, politics, or content creators—are constantly vying for our attention. Marcus’ advice to focus on \"something good\" can be interpreted as learning about virtue, which helps quiet the noise of the world. Alternatively, it can mean focusing on something personally meaningful, not driven by fear of missing out, but chosen for its value.\nHowever, Marcus cautions that even when we think we are focusing on something good, we must beware of aimlessness. Those who live without broader goals, Marcus says, waste their lives in trivial pursuits. I analyze how this warning applies to modern content that distorts Stoicism, particularly hyper-masculine and red-pill ideologies that mislead young men by portraying women as distractions. These misguided ideas lead people to chase false solutions to non-existent problems, wasting time and attention.\nThe meditation emphasizes that distractions are not external forces, but a result of our lack of attention management. A Stoic response is not to eliminate external influences, but to strengthen inner resolve and temperance. Marcus reminds us that a Stoic should not allow external events, like a breakup, to compromise moral character. Instead, the Stoic improves, recognizing that virtue is the only true good, and distractions—whether relationships or the noise of society—are indifferent unless we let them affect us.\n\"Do things from outside break in to distract you? Give yourself a time of quiet to learn some new good thing and cease to wander out of your course. But, when you have done that, be on your guard against a second kind of wandering. For those who are sick to death in life, with no mark on which they direct every impulse or in general every imagination, are triflers, not in words only but also in their deeds.\" - Meditations 2.7\n--\nGo ad-free : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nFollow the print publication : https://stoicismpod.com/print\nTake the free course : https://understandingstoicism.com\nOrder my book : https://stoicismpod.com/book\nSource Text : https://stoicismpod.com/far\nLearn more about your ad choices.

I dive into the Stoic concept of violence, explaining that true violence, in Stoic terms, is the damage we do to our own moral character through vice, not the physical acts we traditionally associate with violence. Using examples like murder, I explain how Stoicism teaches that no external action can harm another’s virtue, but choosing to act unjustly damages our own character. This episode also touches on the nuanced relationship between Stoicism, religion, and moral decision-making, emphasizing that for Stoics, the measure of uprightness is the quality of one’s character, aligned with Nature and the pursuit of virtue.\n\"You are doing yourself violence, violence, my soul; and you will have no second occasion to do yourself honour.

I break down the importance of being aligned with nature and explain how Marcus Aurelius emphasizes the need to be in awe of the Cosmos, rather than \"god-fearing\" as some translations might suggest. I also touch on how we should fulfill our roles and responsibilities according to our nature, using the Stoic principle of Oikeiosis to live a life aligned with the Cosmos.\n\"Each hour be minded valiantly as becomes a Roman and a man to do what is to your hand with preciseness . . . and unaffected dignity natural love freedom and justice; and to give yourself repose from every other imagination. And so you will if only you do each act as though it were your last freed from every random aim from willful turning away from the directing Reason from pretense self-love and displeasure with what is allotted to you.

    "description": "In this episode, we delve into Meditation 2.3 of Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations. We explore the concepts of Providence and the interconnectedness of the universe as understood by the Stoics. We discuss how everything in the cosmos, including human life, is part of a logical and stable system governed by natural laws. Additionally, we touch upon the Stoic view of change and how it contributes to the stability of the universe. The practical takeaway? Embrace the logical nature of the cosmos, understand that change is not our enemy but rather a necessary aspect of existence, and remember that the answer to a contented life doesn’t lie in external sources like books or gurus but in accepting and playing our part in the grand scheme of things.\nQuoted Meditation:\n“The work of the gods is full of Providence: the work of Fortune is not divorced from Nature or the spinning and winding of the threads ordained by Providence. All flows from that other world; and there is, besides, necessity and the wellbeing of the whole universe, whereof you are a part. Now to every part of Nature that is good which the nature of the Whole brings, and which preserves that nature; and the whole world is preserved as much by the changes of the compound bodies as by the changes of the elements which compose those bodies. Let this be sufficient for you, these be continually your doctrines. But put away your thirst for books, that so you may not die murmuring, but truly reconciled and grateful from your heart to the gods.” — Meditations, 2.3\n--\nGo ad-free : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nFollow the print publication : https://stoicismpod.com/print\nTake the free course : https://understandingstoicism.com\nOrder my book : https://stoicismpod.com/book\nSource Text : https://stoicismpod.com/far\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "description": "In today’s episode, we explore Meditations 2.2 by Marcus Aurelius, diving into the Stoic understanding of our bodies, the concept of the “god” in Stoicism, and the relationship between our physical body, life-sustaining breath, and rational mind. Marcus identifies these three parts of the human being and challenges us to take control of the only one we can—the governing self, or rational mind.\nWe also touch on the Stoic concept of Logos, the naturalistic “god” that underpins the universe, and discuss the Stoic perspective on the body as a temporary vessel on loan from the universe. Finally, we delve into the importance of not letting our minds be controlled by selfish impulses or distractions, emphasizing the Stoic practice of paying attention to our thoughts and actions as the path to living a virtuous life.\nMeditation Quoted:\n“This whatever it is that I am, is flesh and vital spirit and the governing self. Disdain the flesh: blood and bones and network, a twisted skein of nerves, veins, arteries. Consider also what the vital spirit is: a current of air, not even continuously the same, but every hour being expelled and sucked in again. There is then a third part, the governing self. Put away your books, be distracted no longer, they are not your portion. Rather, as if on the point of death, reflect like this: 'you are an old man, suffer this governing part of you no longer to be in bondage, no longer to be a puppet pulled by selfish impulse, no longer to be indignant with what is allotted in the present or to suspect what is allotted in the future.'” (Meditations, 2.2)\n--\nGo ad-free : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nFollow the print publication : https://stoicismpod.com/print\nTake the free course : https://understandingstoicism.com\nOrder my book : https://stoicismpod.com/book\nSource Text : https://stoicismpod.com/far\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "description": "In this first episode of Season 2, we dive into one of my favorite meditations from Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 2.1. I’ll be using the Farquharson translation throughout this season, and today, I’m excited to get started.\nMeditation Quoted:\n\"Say to yourself in the early morning: I shall meet today inquisitive, ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, uncharitable men. All these things have come upon them through ignorance of real good and ill. But I, because I have seen that the nature of good is the right, and of ill the wrong, and that the nature of the man himself who does wrong is akin to my own (not of the same blood and seed, but partaking with me in mind, that is in a portion of divinity), I can neither be harmed by any of them, for no man will involve me in wrong, nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him; for we have come into the world to work together, like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of upper and lower teeth. To work against one another therefore is to oppose Nature, and to be vexed with another or to turn away from him is to tend to antagonism.\" -- (Meditations, 2.1)\nIn this episode, I explore how Marcus’s reflection captures the essence of Stoicism by reminding us of the importance of viewing others with compassion, even when they act out of ignorance. We are all striving toward Virtue, and acknowledging our shared imperfections can foster a deeper sense of unity and purpose.\nI also discuss the Stoic concepts of Virtue, the Unity of Virtue, and the idea that no one does wrong knowingly. These ideas challenge us to reconsider our judgments of others and ourselves, recognizing that everyone is acting from their own perceived understanding of what is right—even if that understanding is flawed.\nFinally, I leave you with two questions to ponder and discuss in the comments: How well do you balance your service to the greater good with your own personal well-being? And how do you manage the conflict between your higher ideals and the distractions of daily life?\n--\nGo ad-free : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nFollow the print publication : https://stoicismpod.com/print\nTake the free course : https://understandingstoicism.com\nOrder my book : https://stoicismpod.com/book\nSource Text : https://stoicismpod.com/far\nLearn more about your ad choices.

This season is not a reimagining but a refresh, building on the knowledge I've accumulated since I first started this podcast in 2022. While Season One was an exploratory beginning, Season Two aims to dive deeper into the Stoic canon with greater insight and understanding.\nIn this episode, I explain some key Stoic vocabulary you'll need to know, such as \"Prokoptôn,\" \"Virtue,\" \"sage,\" \"impression,\" and \"assent.\" I also discuss the Stoic concepts of \"Good,\" \"Bad,\" and \"indifferents,\" clarifying common misconceptions about Stoicism and how it guides us in making moral choices.\nAdditionally, I touch on the Stoic Circles of Concern and introduce my Pyramid of Concern, a tool I developed to help us better understand and prioritize our roles and responsibilities in the context of Stoic ethics.\nFinally, I discuss the Dichotomy of Control—or, as I prefer to call it, the Dichotomy of Choice—emphasizing the importance of focusing on what we can choose and letting go of what we cannot.\nThis season will revisit the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, starting with Book 2, Meditation 1. Together, we'll explore Stoic philosophy in a way that is both deep and accessible, aiming to help you progress on your path toward Virtue.\nThanks for being here, and I'm looking forward to this journey with you.

Fast forward to today, and the podcast now averages around 4 million plays a year. Along the way, I've written over half a million words on Stoicism, co-authored a book, and gained recognition as a Stoic philosopher within the academic community.\nWith all this growth and learning, I realized that some of the early episodes of this podcast may not be as accurate or insightful as I'd like them to be today. Rather than delete them, I've moved all 233 of those episodes into Season 1, creating a clear division between where I started and where we’re headed now.\nSo, what can you expect from Season 2?\nI've learned that most of you appreciate a mix of ancient wisdom straight from the source, coupled with informed interpretations on how to apply that wisdom in contemporary life. You’re not necessarily strict Stoics, but rather individuals from diverse backgrounds looking for practical insights to incorporate into your own life philosophies.\nIn Season 2, I'll continue to provide practical Stoic advice while also diving deeper into the ancient theories and how they can be applied today. The podcast will remain a place for practical guidance, while my weekly digital print publication at stoicismpod.com/print will explore more advanced Stoic concepts for those who want to go further.\nWe’re starting this new season by revisiting the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, beginning with Book 2. This is a reboot, and I’m bringing all the knowledge I’ve gained since the podcast began.\nI hope you enjoy this refreshed journey into Stoicism.

I discuss how we often identify with various subordinate identities, such as our gender, profession, nationality, or personal preferences, and how these can sometimes overshadow our true identity.\nI propose that, according to Stoic philosophy, we all share a single Cardinal Identity: Human Citizen of the Cosmos. This identity transcends all subordinate identities and unites us as part of a greater whole. I explore the potential pitfalls of over-identifying with our subordinate identities, which can lead to division and a narrow view of ourselves.\nThrough this discussion, I aim to shift the focus from these subordinate identities to our shared Cardinal Identity. By recognizing and embracing this Cardinal Identity, we can better fulfill our roles and contribute to the greater good of the cosmopolis.\nJoin me as I explore how understanding our true identity can help us live more virtuous and fulfilling lives, and how we can balance our various roles and characteristics without losing sight of our shared humanity.\n--\nShare your thoughts : https://stoicismpod.com/ai\nBecome a Patron : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nDownload the Stoicism260 app : https://stoicism260.com\nSubscribe to the Newsletter : https://practicalstoicism.net\nEnroll in the course : https://understandingstoicism.com\nOrder my book : https://stoicismpod.com/book\nJoin the Society of Stoics : https://societyofstoics.org\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "description": "In this episode, I open up about my own health challenges, sharing that while I am \"blood healthy\", I am also carrying around some excess weight. This personal context sets the stage for a broader discussion on health and Stoicism.\nI emphasize that taking care of our bodies is generally morally appropriate, but our approach to health must be contextually related to our abilities and circumstances. Stoicism teaches that the moral judgment of our approach to health is not linked to outcomes but to the moral reasoning guiding our actions.\nI discuss the importance of balancing our roles and ensuring they do not conflict with one another. Using the example of a university student named David, I illustrate how different roles must be fulfilled in harmony, without one undermining another. David’s approach to health is contextually appropriate, balancing his roles as a student, family member, partner, friend, and aspiring Stoic.\nI also address the misconceptions promoted by some \"Stoic\" masculinity influencers, who wrongly associate Stoicism with physical prowess and aggressive masculinity. True Stoicism is about logically understanding reality and making just moral choices, not about meeting arbitrary physical standards.\nThe key takeaway is that while physical health is an indifferent, our choices regarding health are not. Making contextually appropriate efforts toward health is a reflection of our moral character. I urge listeners to be honest with themselves about their efforts and to avoid using Stoic concepts as excuses for inaction.\nJoin me as I explore the intersection of health and Stoicism, and how we can make virtuous choices to support our well-being.\n--\nBecome a Patron : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nDownload the Stoicism260 app : https://stoicism260.com\nSubscribe to the Newsletter : https://practicalstoicism.net\nEnroll in the course : https://understandingstoicism.com\nOrder my book : https://stoicismpod.com/book\nJoin the Society of Stoics : https://societyofstoics.org\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "description": "Welcome back, my dear Stoic progressor. In today’s episode, I dive into a topic that may seem unfamiliar to some but is deeply relevant to many – the pressures and anxieties faced by students in the Philippines. Drawing on personal insights and the experiences shared by a listener, I explore the unique challenges that Filipino students encounter, from economic hardships to intense familial expectations.\nAs someone who has gained a unique perspective on Filipino culture through my marriage and personal experiences, I aim to provide valuable advice not just for Filipino students but for all young people struggling with the anxiety of school, whether it be college, high school, or earlier grades. I discuss the strong sense of familial duty ingrained in Filipino culture and how it often leads to a repression of individuality, creating a complex dynamic between personal ambitions and family obligations.\nThroughout the episode, I will share practical Stoic wisdom to help students navigate these pressures. We'll explore the importance of focusing on what we can control – our attitudes, thoughts, and emotions – and how to cultivate a healthy relationship with expectations. By examining scenarios relatable to Filipino students, I offer strategies to balance familial responsibilities with personal growth, emphasizing that the pursuit of Virtue is central to Stoic philosophy.\nWhether you’re a student in the Philippines or anywhere else, this episode aims to provide you with tools to manage stress and anxiety, honor your commitments to family, and stay true to your personal goals. Join me as we journey through these challenges together, seeking to live morally and justly while striving for inner peace and contentment.\n--\nBecome a Patron : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nDownload the Stoicism260 app : https://stoicism260.com\nSubscribe to the Newsletter : https://practicalstoicism.net\nEnroll in the course : https://understandingstoicism.com\nOrder my book : https://stoicismpod.com/book\nJoin the Society of Stoics : https://societyofstoics.org\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "description": "In this episode, I take a fresh look at Hierocles' Circles of Concern and how my understanding of them has evolved. Communicating Stoicism to beginners involves striking a balance between simplicity and the depth of the philosophy, which can sometimes lead to misunderstandings.\nI address a recent discussion on the /Stoic subreddit that highlighted the problem of using complex Stoic terminology without fully understanding it. This can create a false sense of authority and perpetuate incorrect interpretations of Stoicism. I emphasize that practice is more important than book learning and that true Stoicism involves living the philosophy, not just knowing the vocabulary.\nI also correct a common misconception about the Circles of Concern. The self is not at the center of the concept but is part of a holistic understanding of Stoicism. I discuss how focusing on the mind as the starting point is crucial, but it does not mean prioritizing oneself over others. Instead, Stoicism teaches that all concerns are interconnected and equally important.\nUsing the analogy of a snake eating its own tail, I explain how the mind initiates and maintains the process of living according to Nature, but is no more central than the rest of Nature. This continuous effort is essential to achieving Virtue.\nJoin me as I clarify these concepts and explore the true meaning of Hierocles' Circles of Concern.\n--\nBecome a Patron : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nDownload the Stoicism260 app : https://stoicism260.com\nSubscribe to the Newsletter : https://practicalstoicism.net\nEnroll in the course : https://understandingstoicism.com\nOrder my book : https://stoicismpod.com/book\nJoin the Society of Stoics : https://societyofstoics.org\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "title": "Fate Is Not Yet Written",
    "date": "Tue, 18 Jun 2024 05:17:23 -0000",
    "description": "In this episode, I delve into the concept of fate within Stoic philosophy, a topic that often sparks varied opinions. The Stoics believed in a deterministic universe, where a physical causal chain dictates the flow of events. However, this idea can feel restrictive, suggesting that nothing we do could be otherwise.\nI explore how we can view this deterministic outlook as both true and untrue, using Chrysippus' analogy of the cylinder and the cone to illustrate how we react to external forces based on our unique 'shapes.' I explain the Stoic distinction between corporeal and incorporeal things, proposing a similar division within the causal chain: a physical chain we cannot control and a metaphysical chain influenced by our rational choices.\nDespite the Stoic belief that the mind and its processes are physical, I introduce the concept of 'lekta' or sayables, which are incorporeal yet impactful. I argue that choices, like lekta, are incorporeal outcomes of physical processes, influencing the physical world.\nThis episode suggests that while fate may seem predetermined, our choices play a crucial role in shaping the future. We are co-authors of our destiny, and recognizing this power is essential for the pursuit of Virtue.\nJoin me as I navigate this intricate discussion, challenging the idea of a finalized fate and emphasizing our role in co-authoring what happens next.\n--\nBecome a Patron : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nDownload the daily app : https://stoicism260.com\nSubscribe to the Newsletter : https://practicalstoicism.net\nEnroll in the course : https://understandingstoicism.com\nOrder my book : https://stoicismpod.com/book\nJoin the Society of Stoics : https://societyofstoics.org\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "title": "Stoicism Isn't About Equality",
    "date": "Tue, 11 Jun 2024 10:53:00 -0000",
    "description": "In this episode, I explore the complex relationship between Stoicism and the concept of equality. While the title may be partly clickbait, it also highlights a significant discussion on how Stoicism views equality and justice.\nI delve into how modern society has become disconnected from coherent moral reasoning, driven largely by raw emotions rather than philosophical principles. This episode is not an excuse to dismiss fairness or justice; rather, it's a call to understand these concepts through the lens of Stoic philosophy.\nI discuss the definition of equality as a state of being equal, especially in status, rights, or opportunities, and examine how practical implementation can become complicated. Using a hypothetical scenario about medical school admissions, I illustrate how well-intentioned ideas can quickly become complex.\nFrom a Stoic standpoint, I explain that you cannot please everyone and that individuals cannot control whether others are pleased. However, Stoicism also emphasizes the importance of caring about injustices and treating others justly and fairly.\nI address the misconception that Stoicism promotes a dismissive attitude towards those who suffer injustices. True Stoicism requires us to pursue Virtue, which involves knowing our role in the Cosmopolis, treating others justly, and showing appropriate concern for those within our circles.\nListeners are challenged to consider how they respond to injustice, both when they witness it and when they experience it themselves. Stoicism does not advocate for virtue signaling or acting viciously in response to injustice. Instead, it calls for reasoned and virtuous choices, regardless of outcomes.\nFinally, I clarify that while Stoicism is not concerned with the outcome of equality, it cares deeply about the virtuous choices we make in relation to it. The pursuit of Virtue should guide our actions and concerns, not the pursuit of specific outcomes.\n--\nBecome a Patron : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nDownload the daily app : https://stoicism260.com\nSubscribe to the Newsletter : https://practicalstoicism.net\nEnroll in the course : https://understandingstoicism.com\nOrder my book : https://stoicismpod.com/book\nJoin the Society of Stoics : https://societyofstoics.org\nLearn more about your ad choices.

I emphasize that caring for the environment is not a political issue but a fundamental aspect of Stoic philosophy.\nI explore the Stoic belief in living in harmony with Nature, highlighting that Stoicism requires us to make morally just choices that respect the natural world. I explain that freedom, according to the Stoics, is the discipline to make virtuous choices that align with Nature's order.\nI challenge listeners to consider their personal impact on the environment, such as the necessity of driving heavily polluting vehicles and the environmental cost of importing exotic foods out of season. Drawing from Stoic teachings, I urge prioritizing rational and ethical behavior over personal convenience and luxury.\nThis episode encourages reflection on how to reconcile actions with Stoic values and make thoughtful, virtue-driven decisions regarding environmental issues.\n--\nBecome a Patron : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nDownload the daily app : https://stoicism260.com\nSubscribe to the Newsletter : https://practicalstoicism.net\nEnroll in the course : https://understandingstoicism.com\nOrder my book : https://stoicismpod.com/book\nJoin the Society of Stoics : https://societyofstoics.org\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "title": "Stoicism Is Not Compatible With Your Religion",
    "date": "Tue, 28 May 2024 14:24:56 -0000",
    "description": "In this episode, I explore the fundamental differences between Stoicism and Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), explaining why these systems are inherently incompatible. Religions personify God and base their moral frameworks on divine approval, while Stoicism views God as a natural, impersonal force synonymous with Nature itself.\nI discuss how one can adopt certain Stoic practices without fully embracing Stoicism, similar to appreciating elements of another religion without converting to it. However, identifying as both a Stoic and a follower of an Abrahamic religion is as contradictory as claiming to be a Christian Muslim due to the conflicting foundational beliefs. For instance, Christianity's belief in Jesus as the son of God starkly contrasts with Islam's view of Jesus as a prophet.\nIdentifying as a Stoic involves satisfying specific criteria unique to Stoicism, just as identifying with a religion requires adherence to its distinct beliefs and practices. Religions posit a supernatural, purposeful God whose word is conveyed through scriptures, while Stoicism sees God as the cosmos, emphasizing living in harmony with Nature's rational order.\nI address the intellectual rigor behind both religions and Stoicism, acknowledging the profound efforts of their founders to answer life's big questions. Mixing different philosophies or religions often results in new, distinct systems rather than a harmonious blend. Even attempts like Neostoicism, which sought to merge Stoicism with Christianity, have largely failed.\nDespite these differences, both systems ask fundamental questions about living a virtuous life. However, the answers and methods proposed by each are often mutually exclusive. While individual Stoic teachings can resonate with religious adherents, the underlying cosmology and logic of Stoicism remain incompatible with theistic frameworks.\nI caution religious listeners about the potential challenges of exploring Stoicism deeply, as it may lead to difficult questions about their faith and identity. Embracing such philosophical inquiries, however, is part of the journey toward understanding and personal growth.\nIn this episode, I explore these complex intersections between Stoicism and religion and provide insights into how different systems approach the quest for a virtuous life.\n--\nBecome a Patron : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nDownload the daily app : https://stoicism260.com\nSubscribe to the Newsletter : https://practicalstoicism.net\nEnroll in the course : https://understandingstoicism.com\nOrder my book : https://stoicismpod.com/book\nJoin the Society of Stoics : https://societyofstoics.org\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "title": "Celebrating The Positive Without Ignoring The Mournful",
    "date": "Tue, 21 May 2024 09:00:00 -0000",
    "description": "Good morning, Prokoptôn. In today's episode, I'm responding to a question from a Spotify listener named Blarka. The question is about how to think of or celebrate a birthday that coincides with the death of a brother or sister.\nThis is a thoughtful question with a sad context, but it's an important topic. While Stoicism views death as an indifferent in terms of developing Virtue, it acknowledges the emotional impact it has on us. It's essential to remember that Stoics are allowed to have emotions.\nFirst, I discuss the Stoic perspective on death. For Stoics, death doesn't signify the end of everything. Instead, it's part of a continuous cycle of endings and beginnings. The \"spark of divine reason\" within us doesn't cease to exist when our bodies expire.\nNext, I address the specific issue of feeling conflicted when trying to celebrate on a day also marked by loss. It's natural to feel this way, but it's crucial to examine what our actions on these days say about our character. Celebrating and mourning simultaneously doesn't inherently make either action inappropriate. The appropriateness of our behavior depends on the logic and reasoning behind it.\nIn conclusion, I suggest finding a balanced approach to marking the day of a great loss. This might involve spending time remembering the lost loved one and then allowing yourself to celebrate with friends and family. The key is to ensure that your actions align with reasoned and virtuous thinking.\nThank you for listening, and I hope this discussion provides some intellectual value and practical guidance.\n--\nBecome a Patron : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nDownload the daily app : https://stoicism260.com\nSubscribe to the Newsletter : https://practicalstoicism.net\nEnroll in the course : https://understandingstoicism.com\nOrder my book : https://stoicismpod.com/book\nJoin the Society of Stoics : https://societyofstoics.org\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "description": "In today's episode of Practical Stoicism, I delve into a challenging question often posed by newcomers to Stoicism: \"If the Stoic Sage is purely aspirational, what motivation do we have to work on our character?\" Addressing this, I explore why striving for unattainable ideals, such as perfect health or the perfect dinner, remains essential, despite their inherent impossibility. \nI draw parallels between the pursuit of excellence in various fields—be it medicine, fitness, or culinary arts—and the philosophical journey toward becoming a better Stoic. This episode unpacks the importance of perpetual improvement and how it enriches our lives and professions, despite the certainty that perfection is unachievable. \nI also challenge the notion that the unattainable nature of sagehood undermines the value of Stoicism. By embracing the continuous pursuit of virtue, we acknowledge that while perfection is a myth, the journey toward it is filled with meaningful growth and self-improvement. Join me as I argue that the quest for a virtuous life, much like life itself, is about valuing the journey, not just the destination.\n--\nBecome a Patron : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nDownload the daily app : https://stoicism260.com\nSubscribe to the Newsletter : https://practicalstoicism.net\nEnroll in the course : https://understandingstoicism.com\nOrder my book : https://stoicismpod.com/book\nJoin the Society of Stoics : https://societyofstoics.org\nLearn more about your ad choices.

While Stoicism isn't about adopting an aesthetic of minimalism, it does advocate for simplicity over complexity in many aspects of life. I delve into how living simply, in a Stoic sense, means focusing on what truly matters, reducing unnecessary mental clutter that leads to physical clutter. By reflecting on Seneca's admiration for Scipio Africanus's modest bathhouse, I illustrate the beauty of simplicity and the Stoic pursuit of focusing on essentials.

Join me as we discover Stoicism's timeless wisdom for managing anger and leading a more harmonious life.\n--\nBecome a Patron: https://stoicismpod.com/members\nSubscribe to the weekly newsletter: https://practicalstoicism.net/subscribe\nPre-order my book: https://stoicismpod.com/book\nPodcast Artwork by Randy Johnson: https://originalrandy.com\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "title": "Stoic Strategies For Dealing With Procrastination",
    "date": "Fri, 15 Mar 2024 10:06:46 -0000",
    "description": "In today's episode, I delve into the pervasive issue of procrastination, a mental health symptom that seems to afflict us all in various degrees. From the stress of not being able to afford housing to the pressures of societal expectations, procrastination can manifest in many forms.\nThe Stoics, with their practical philosophy, offered a solution to procrastination through the concept of Memento Mori, or \"remember that you must die.\" By confronting our mortality, we're reminded of the limited time we have and are encouraged to act accordingly. However, as I explore in the episode, simply reminding ourselves of death doesn't always translate into action.\nWe discuss the societal obsession with productivity and the relentless pursuit of efficiency, which often leads to burnout and anxiety. Despite our efforts to maximize productivity, we find ourselves trapped in a cycle of endless tasks and obligations, with little time for genuine relaxation or self-reflection.\nBut there's a way out of this cycle. By redefining our priorities and embracing a mindset focused on virtue rather than productivity, we can reclaim control of our time and lives. This involves recognizing the inherent value of rest, leisure, and personal fulfillment, rather than constantly striving for external measures of success.\nUltimately, the key lies in two practices: Memento Mori, as a gentle reminder of life's finite nature, and the creation of a plan to guide our actions and priorities. With these tools, we can navigate the complexities of modern life with clarity and purpose, free from the burden of endless productivity.\n--\nBecome a Patron: https://stoicismpod.com/members\nSubscribe to the weekly newsletter: https://practicalstoicism.net/subscribe\nPre-order my book: https://stoicismpod.com/book\nPodcast Artwork by Randy Johnson: https://originalrandy.com\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "title": "Dealing With Our Heartbreak Stoically",
    "date": "Mon, 11 Mar 2024 10:00:53 -0000",
    "description": "In this episode I delve into the painful experience of losing a relationship, particularly one that we didn't want to end. I highlight the acute distress caused by breakups, where someone actively chooses to leave, unlike death, which is inevitable and beyond anyone's control. I discuss how Stoicism-inspired reasoning can help alleviate the pain of heartache and navigate through the grief that follows a breakup.\nI emphasize the concept of \"indifferents\" in Stoicism, things that have no power over our ability to choose virtuously. These indifferents prompt us to make choices, but they do not dictate the choices we ultimately make.\nThe episode clarifies the distinction between \"indifferents\" and \"indifference,\" explaining that Stoics do not treat indifferents with indifference. Rather, they carefully consider how their choices regarding indifferents reflect their character and virtue.\nFurthermore, Stoic role ethics are introduced, emphasizing the importance of fulfilling one's roles in life responsibly. The host explains that heartache can hinder our ability to fulfill our roles effectively and underscores the need to address heartache as an indifferent that could impede our progress toward cultivating a good character.\nPractical steps for coping with heartbreak are provided, including acceptance, understanding that another person's unhappiness does not define your worth, focusing on fulfilling other roles in life, and practicing self-care.\nOverall, the episode offers a Stoic perspective on navigating the emotional turmoil of heartbreak with rationality and self-care, emphasizing the importance of understanding and accepting indifferents while striving to fulfill one's roles in life responsibly.\n--\nBecome a Patron: https://stoicismpod.com/members\nSubscribe to the weekly newsletter: https://practicalstoicism.net/subscribe\nPre-order my book: https://stoicismpod.com/book\nPodcast Artwork by Randy Johnson: https://originalrandy.com\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "description": "Greetings, listeners. It's remarkable to witness our community's growth, now exceeding 100,000 listeners every Monday and Friday. Your continued support is truly appreciated.\nToday's episode delves into a thought-provoking query posed by Griff, a dedicated listener and Patron, regarding the relevance of personality types within the context of Stoicism. Griff questions whether such classifications confine individuals rather than foster personal development.\nFrom my perspective, I maintain a degree of skepticism towards these systems. They often serve as tools for self-indulgence rather than avenues for genuine self-improvement. However, I do recognize their practical applications. They can provide valuable insights into our behaviors and guide therapeutic interventions.\nWhile these systems may offer useful insights, it's crucial not to allow them to define us. Instead, we should view them as tools for self-reflection and growth. Let's utilize them wisely, not as rigid identity markers, but as resources for enhancing our understanding of ourselves and facilitating personal development.\n--\nBecome a Patron: https://stoicismpod.com/members\nPre-order my book: https://stoicismpod.com/book\nPodcast Artwork by Randy Johnson: https://originalrandy.com\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "title": "Virtue Is Its Own Reward",
    "date": "Mon, 04 Mar 2024 10:10:00 -0000",
    "description": "In today's episode, I tackle the enduring Stoic principle that \"Virtue is its own reward.\" This exploration is a personal journey into the heart of Stoicism, examining whether this ancient wisdom holds true in our contemporary lives, and I won't shy away from getting a bit salty or taking some swipes along the way.\nWe begin with Meditation 11.4 as our focal point, which encourages us to reflect on our contributions to the common good and to find contentment in these efforts as our reward. This meditation is the springboard into a deeper discussion about the role of Virtue in our lives.\nI openly acknowledge the practical realities of living by Stoic virtues. If I weren't compensated for producing this podcast, I simply wouldn't be able to do it. This admission leads us to the crux of today's topic: how to apply Stoic Virtue in our everyday existence. While Stoicism places Virtue as the highest good, it doesn't ignore the modern complexities we all navigate.\nI critique the notion that to live a Stoic life, one might need to adopt an ascetic lifestyle, devoid of personal belongings or societal ties. However, this view aligns more with Cynicism than Stoicism. Stoicism doesn't advocate for unnecessary hardship but rather for a meaningful life, where challenges are seen as opportunities for growth, not as goals in themselves.\nThe discussion challenges the misconception that Stoics should live in extreme self-denial. Stoicism recognizes our natural human desires, emphasizing that it's possible to want things, be part of a community, and pursue goals that positively impact the Cosmopolis, or the global community.\nAt its core, today's episode reveals that Stoicism teaches Virtue is indeed its own reward, but this doesn't mean withdrawing from the world. Virtue manifests through our actions, decisions, and our influence on our Circles of Concern—the people, animals, and environment we interact with. Stoics are encouraged to live lives that harmonize personal ambitions with the collective good, always acting with the welfare of the community in mind.\nThe key takeaway is that Stoicism is about active participation in life, not seclusion from it. It's about chasing what we want, within reason, and contributing to society in meaningful ways. Stoicism doesn't force us to choose between living virtuously and living fully; it suggests that a truly good life includes both.\nRemember, it's about being a Human Being, appropriately, engaging with the world, pursuing Virtue, and finding fulfillment in the good we do for both others and ourselves.\n--\nBecome a patron: https://stoicismpod.com/members\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "title": "3 Steps To Forgiving Others",
    "date": "Fri, 01 Mar 2024 10:44:28 -0000",
    "description": "In today's episode, I delve into the profound theme of Forgiveness within the framework of Stoicism, a topic that resonates deeply with both my personal experiences and the Stoic principles I strive to embody. I commence with a note of gratitude towards new Patrons – Dan Brann, Jenny Kay, and Jay – whose support is instrumental in dedicating myself fully to this podcast. For those contemplating joining our Patreon, it offers an ad-free listening experience, exclusive articles, discussions with special guests, and a vibrant private Discord community.\nThe essence of today's discourse on Forgiveness is drawn from a personal narrative – my journey of forgiving my mother, a path marked by decades of hurt, distance, and ultimately, reconciliation. This story illustrates not just a personal struggle but encapsulates the Stoic view on external events and our control over them. My childhood, marred by broken promises and absent visitations, laid the groundwork for years of resentment towards my mother. However, the Stoic practice of accepting things beyond our control and focusing on our reactions played a pivotal role in navigating this tumultuous relationship.\nForgiveness, from a Stoic perspective, is intricately tied to the understanding and acceptance of human imperfection, including our own. It is not merely about absolving others but recognizing the limitations within which everyone operates. This realization does not come swiftly or easily; it is a gradual process of internalizing and genuinely believing in the fallibility of all humans, including those who might have wronged us.\nThe episode breaks down Forgiveness into three actionable steps rooted in Stoic philosophy:\n\n\nAcknowledging our lack of control over others' actions and their inherent imperfections.\n\nInternalizing this understanding to a degree where it informs our belief system and reactions.\n\nAdjusting our expectations to align with the reality of human imperfection, thereby reducing the likelihood of disappointment.\n\n\nThis framework for Forgiveness, though not explicitly outlined in Stoic texts, draws inspiration from Stoic principles, particularly the reflections of Marcus Aurelius on self-awareness and mutual human fallibility.\nIn conclusion, Forgiveness, as discussed in this episode, transcends the personal and delves into the philosophical, offering a Stoic approach to dealing with one of the most challenging aspects of human relationships. It's a reminder of the power of acceptance, the importance of adjusting our expectations, and the virtue of empathy towards ourselves and others.\n--\nBecome a Patron: https://stoicismpod.com/members\nPre-order my book: https://stoicismpod.com/book\nPodcast Artwork by Randy Johnson: https://originalrandy.com\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "title": "Dealing with Anger and Rage Through Physical Sport (with Michael Tremblay)",
    "date": "Fri, 09 Feb 2024 08:54:07 -0000",
    "description": "Tanner Campbell converses with Michael Tremblay, an MMA fighter, writer, and co-creator of Stoa Stoic Meditations app. They delve into several topics, including the role of sport and exercise in addressing rage and anger.\nMichael Tremblay shares his insights on the practice of martial arts, particularly Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and its philosophical alignment with Stoicism. He emphasizes how martial arts were his first exposure to explicit moral education, teaching not just physical skills but also the importance of character development, self-control, and ethical behavior.\nDiscussing anger, Tremblay highlights the Stoic perspective, as outlined by Seneca, which views anger as a reaction to perceived harm that demands punishment. He distinguishes between two types of anger: the immediate, reactionary kind often experienced in daily frustrations, and a deeper, more persistent anger stemming from significant personal betrayals or grievances.\nTremblay notes that while physical activities like martial arts can effectively mitigate the immediate, reactionary anger, they are less effective in addressing deeper, long-standing feelings of rage or betrayal. He explains how Stoicism helps navigate these emotions by encouraging a present-focused mindset, acknowledging past mistakes while striving to change and improve.\nIn dealing with regret, Tremblay and Campbell agree that while Stoicism advocates for acceptance and moving forward, it also acknowledges the natural feelings of sadness and shame that come with regret. They underscore the importance of understanding and transforming these feelings constructively, focusing on the present and future actions rather than dwelling on past errors.\nThe conversation also touches upon Epictetus, his background as a slave, and his philosophical teachings. Tremblay provides insights into Epictetus's approach to teaching young Roman men destined for politics or industry, emphasizing the importance of not just learning philosophy but living it.\nIn summary, the podcast highlights the value of physical disciplines like martial arts in managing immediate anger and stress, while recognizing the need for philosophical reflection and self-improvement in addressing deeper emotional issues. The discussion reinforces the Stoic principles of focusing on present actions, accepting the past, and continually striving for personal growth and ethical living.\n--\nBecome a Patron: https://stoicismpod.com/members\nCheck out Neurohacker: https://neurohacker.com/practical\nPodcast Artwork by Randy Johnson: https://originalrandy.com\nStoa Conversations: https://open.spotify.com/episode/7wHSqUf6BZDIUBDu0YgAAs\nStoa Meditation App: https://stoameditation.com\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "description": "In this week's episode of \"Practical Stoicism,\" host Tanner Campbell tackles a diverse set of questions from Patreon supporters, diving deep into the application of Stoicism in modern life. Campbell begins by addressing the nature of Stoicism as a practical philosophy that requires active engagement and contextual understanding, warning against the misuse of Stoic quotes out of context, akin to religious dogmatism. He emphasizes that Stoicism, much like any philosophy, demands practice and interpretation rather than rote memorization of texts.\nThe episode covers four main questions:\n1. The distinction between externals and indifferents, particularly our bodies, and how Stoicism views the impact of physical health on mental well-being. Campbell clarifies that while our bodies are considered indifferent, how we choose to care for them is not, highlighting the importance of personal responsibility in maintaining health.\n2. Strategies for using Stoic principles to prevent coworkers' actions from negatively affecting one's day. The host suggests that adopting a Stoic mindset involves choosing not to let external behaviors dictate one's emotional state, underscoring the value of practicing Stoicism in interpersonal relationships.\n3. The ethical considerations of vegetarian and vegan diets through a Stoic lens. Campbell explores the ancient Stoics' views on extravagance and simplicity in diet, ultimately arguing for a balanced approach that respects both personal health and the treatment of animals.\n4. The potential conflict between striving for sagehood and technological or societal progress. The discussion centers on whether the pursuit of Stoic ideals might hinder innovation, with Campbell concluding that Stoicism encourages curiosity and the rational pursuit of ideas that align with one's nature and contribute to the common good.\nCampbell's thoughtful exploration of these topics demonstrates Stoicism's relevance in addressing contemporary ethical dilemmas and personal challenges. By emphasizing contextual understanding and the practical application of Stoic principles, the episode invites listeners to engage more deeply with Stoicism as a guide to living well.\n--\nBecome a Patron: https://stoicismpod.com/members\nCheck out Neurohacker: https://neurohacker.com/practical\nPodcast Artwork by Randy Johnson: https://originalrandy.com\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "date": "Fri, 02 Feb 2024 10:18:00 -0000",
    "description": "Donald Robertson joins Tanner Campbell to discuss his new book, \"Marcus Aurelius: The Stoic Emperor,\" published by Yale University Press. The conversation delves into the life and philosophy of Marcus Aurelius, shedding light on both well-documented and lesser-known aspects of his reign.\nRobertson emphasizes the substantial amount of information available about Marcus Aurelius, more so than for most other ancient philosophers. Despite historical gaps and unreliable sources, a wealth of details about his reign, personal writings, and even his appearance at various stages of life is accessible. This rich trove of information provides a detailed picture of his life, philosophy, and the era he lived in.\nAn interesting topic discussed is Marcus Aurelius's engagement in activities such as leading a dance troupe known as the \"College of the Salii\" or \"The Leaping Priests.\" This group performed martial dances in honor of Mars, the god of war, serving both a religious function and preparing young men for military service. The discussion portrays Marcus Aurelius as a multifaceted emperor deeply involved in the cultural and religious practices of his time.\nThe conversation also touches on the historical and personal challenges Marcus Aurelius encountered, including the political intrigue and his complex relationship with Hadrian. Robertson suggests that the environment of suspicion and surveillance under Hadrian likely influenced Marcus Aurelius's philosophical reflections and his cautious approach to governance.\nFurthermore, Robertson explores potential controversies and interpretations surrounding Marcus Aurelius's life, particularly his upbringing under Hadrian's influence. The dialogue hints at the darker aspects of Roman society and governance, including exploitation and manipulation at the highest levels of power.\nRobertson's insights into Marcus Aurelius extend beyond his philosophical musings, offering a glimpse into his personal experiences and the societal norms of his era. The book promises a comprehensive and nuanced portrayal of one of Stoicism's most revered figures, supported by thorough research and historical accuracy.\nThis episode anticipates the revelations in \"Marcus Aurelius: The Stoic Emperor\" and underscores the importance of understanding historical figures within the full context of their lives. Robertson’s work aims to provide a detailed exploration of the Stoic emperor’s life and legacy.\nFor those interested in Donald Robertson's examination of Marcus Aurelius, \"Marcus Aurelius: The Stoic Emperor\" is available on Amazon.\n--\nBecome a Patron: https://stoicismpod.com/members\nCheck out Neurohacker: https://neurohacker.com/practical\nPodcast Artwork by Randy Johnson: https://originalrandy.com\nPurchase Donald's new book : https://a.co/d/90ZftVw\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "title": "Should Women Study Philosophy?",
    "date": "Mon, 29 Jan 2024 10:00:00 -0000",
    "description": "In today's episode, I explored the question of whether women should engage in the study of philosophy, particularly Stoicism, through the lens of Musonius Rufus, a Roman Stoic philosopher. Musonius was asked if daughters should receive the same education as sons, and his response is profoundly relevant today, especially in discussions about gender roles in philosophy.\nStoicism, often perceived as a male-dominated philosophy, asserts that Virtue – the knowledge of how to live excellently – is attainable by anyone, regardless of gender. This principle is rooted in the belief that both men and women possess the same rational faculty – a brain capable of learning and understanding. The slight physical variations between genders do not impede the ability to acquire knowledge, including Virtue. Just as men and women can learn skills like math or carpentry, both can equally learn and practice Virtue.\nMusonius, whose teachings have been passed down over centuries, believed firmly in the equality of men and women in their capability and inclination toward Virtue. According to him, both genders have been endowed with reason by the gods, share the same senses, and have similar body parts. More crucially, both have a natural tendency toward virtue and are equally capable of distinguishing good from bad.\nHe argued that if both men and women are naturally inclined to virtue and capable of discerning right from wrong, there's no logical reason why the study of philosophy – the pursuit of a good life – should be exclusive to men. If it's fitting for men to be good, it's equally fitting for women.\nMusonius went further to describe qualities that are ideal for a woman leading a good life, suggesting that these are best nurtured through the study of philosophy. He contended that a woman versed in philosophy would be a better housekeeper, a prudent manager of household affairs, chaste, self-controlled, not given to excessive grief or uncontrolled emotion, and a just and courageous individual. These teachings of philosophy, he argued, are universal and apply equally to men and women.\nAddressing concerns that women engaging in philosophy might become arrogant or neglectful of their duties, Musonius emphasized that philosophy should be a practical guide to life. He compared it to medicine, which is valuable only if it contributes to the health of the body. Similarly, philosophy is meaningful if it leads to the betterment of the soul.\nThe overarching point Musonius made was that everyone, regardless of gender, should fulfill their duties and roles virtuously. His views, though rooted in the gender norms of his time, transcend these to focus on the universal human duty to care for our circles of concern, control desires, maintain emotional stability, and act courageously.\nIn conclusion, Musonius Rufus, a thinker ahead of his time, affirmed that the pursuit of Stoic Virtue is not confined by gender. His teachings remind us that the path to sagehood and the practice of Virtue are open to all, encouraging a more inclusive understanding of Stoicism that resonates with contemporary perspectives on gender equality in the pursuit of philosophical knowledge.\n--\nBecome a Patron : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nVisit the store : https://store.stoicismpod.com\nCheck out Neurohacker : https://neurohacker.com/practical\nPodcast Artwork by Randy Johnson: https://originalrandy.com\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "title": "Turning Regret Into Stoic Growth",
    "date": "Fri, 26 Jan 2024 10:05:00 -0000",
    "description": "In today's episode, I dove into a contemplative discussion on grief, regret, and the nature of our reactions to loss, drawing inspiration from Seneca's \"Letters of Consolation to Marcia.\" Seneca, in his own verbose manner, offered insights on dealing with the loss of a loved one, a topic that often intertwines with regret, especially when that loss is sudden and unexpected.\nI began by highlighting a significant excerpt from Seneca's letters, where he acknowledges the naturalness of sorrow over losing one's children but stresses the importance of reasonableness in grief. This discussion led me to explore the concept of regret in the context of death and loss, positing that all forms of regret stem from some loss, whether it be a life, an opportunity, or a relationship.\nDelving into whether regret is natural, I suggested that while regret may be normative, it might not align with our true nature if we lived as sages, perfectly rational and moral beings. As sages, we wouldn't perceive loss, death, or ended relationships as inherently negative. This raised the question: Should we expect sage-like behavior from ourselves and others, or is it merely an ideal?\nI proposed viewing regret as a crossroads, a chance to reconsider our perspectives on life's events. For instance, instead of regretting what we did wrong in a relationship, why not feel gratitude for the joyous moments shared? This shift in perspective can transform regret into an opportunity for growth and self-improvement.\nAddressing regret for things we believe negatively impacted others, like feeling responsible for someone's unhappiness or death, I emphasized the importance of taking responsibility and using these feelings as motivation for change. These moments of regret are reminders of our journey towards a better self, a chance to acknowledge our past imperfections and commit to a more mindful and virtuous path forward.\nIn conclusion, dealing with regret as Stoics, or more accurately as Prokoptôn, involves recognizing it as an opportunity to make better choices. It's about accepting our past mistakes, learning from them, and continuously striving to align our actions with Virtue. Regret, then, becomes not a burden but a catalyst for personal growth and a deeper understanding of our journey towards Stoic ideals.\n--\nBecome a Patron : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nVisit the store : https://store.stoicismpod.com\nCheck out Neurohacker : https://neurohacker.com/practical\nPodcast Artwork by Randy Johnson: https://originalrandy.com\nCheck out Will's podcast : https://www.willjohncock.com/techno-umbilico\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "title": "Sensual Pleasure",
    "date": "Mon, 22 Jan 2024 10:00:00 -0000",
    "description": "In today's podcast episode, I explored Meditation 10 from Book 8 of Marcus Aurelius' \"Meditations.\" This particular meditation delves into the nature of repentance, pleasure, and their relationship with virtue. Marcus asserts that repentance is a self-reproof for neglecting something useful, and what is truly good must always be useful. He concludes that sensual pleasure, therefore, is neither good nor useful.\nMarcus’ meditation might initially seem to advocate for a life devoid of pleasure, echoing a stereotypical stoic rejection of sensual experiences. However, I aimed to provide a more nuanced interpretation. While virtue, the only good in Stoicism, is indeed always useful, it doesn’t necessarily imply that anything not perpetually useful is devoid of value.\nRepentance, as discussed by Marcus, is about recognizing the lost opportunity for something beneficial, aligning with Stoic principles. But when he suggests that no sage would repent refusing sensual pleasure, it’s vital to understand the context of utility in Stoicism. Pleasure, especially sensual pleasure, is not inherently good in the Stoic framework, but it's not always harmful either. It’s classified as an ‘indifferent’ – something that neither contributes to nor detracts from virtue.\nIn real-life scenarios, the utility of pleasure can be highly context-dependent. For instance, sexual pleasure within a relationship might foster intimacy and connection, aligning with one’s duties in the Circles of Concern. In this sense, pleasure can be situationally useful.\nI speculated that Marcus’ harsh stance on pleasure might have stemmed from personal struggles or the context of his times. It’s important to remember that “Meditations” was a personal journal, reflecting his thoughts and struggles, not always a prescriptive guide for all.\nI emphasized that attempting to completely reject pleasure is unrealistic and unnecessary. Stoicism advises moderation and mindful engagement with life’s pleasures. It’s about how we interact with ‘indifferents’ like pleasure and how these interactions reflect our character. Engaging healthily with pleasure can indeed be a part of a virtuous life.\nIn conclusion, while Marcus Aurelius provides a stern view on pleasure, a contemporary Stoic perspective recognizes the role of pleasure as an indifferent. It’s not about banishing pleasure but about engaging with it in a way that’s aligned with our character and virtues. This approach reflects a more balanced and realistic application of Stoic principles in modern life.\nRemember, you can further support this exploration of Stoicism by becoming a patron, removing ads, and joining our community for deeper discussions.\n--\nBecome a Patron : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nCheck out Neurohacker's Qualia Mind : https://neurohacker.com/practical\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "title": "Virtue And Choices In Everyday Stoicism",
    "date": "Fri, 19 Jan 2024 10:23:00 -0000",
    "description": "In today's podcast episode, I tackled some thought-provoking listener questions, providing insights into how to approach life's complexities through a Stoic lens. The first question came from listener \"Modern Rust\", who asked about prioritizing roles in life. My response emphasized the Stoic principle that no roles should contradict each other. The key lies in understanding the Circles of Concern, starting with the self at the center. I explained that prioritizing ourselves means appropriately caring for things beyond ourselves, extending to family, community, and beyond. Each role must align with our responsibility to our own well-being and should not conflict with our roles in other circles.\nThe discussion ventured into more complex scenarios, like serving in the military or facing moral dilemmas at work. I stressed that actions in one circle must benefit the others. For instance, defending one's country is justified if it aligns with personal, familial, and communal responsibilities. The Stoic approach isn't about blind obedience to external demands but about careful consideration of how our actions impact all aspects of our lives and the broader community.\nListener Arkhê posed the second question, seeking elaboration on the Stoic concept that possessing one virtue inherently means possessing all others. I expressed my perspective as a podcaster, not a formal academic, focusing on making Stoicism practical for everyday life. I discussed the Unity of Virtue, explaining that true bravery, for example, requires wisdom, temperance, and justice. This unity suggests that perfect virtue, or sagehood, is an ideal we strive for, not necessarily a state we achieve. This perspective allows for continuous self-improvement within the Stoic practice.\nThe final question from BattleBaby touched on the balance between Stoic reserve and assertiveness. I addressed the misconception that Stoicism advocates for passivity or being a doormat. Instead, Stoicism encourages thoughtful, well-reasoned actions that reflect our character and understanding. Whether facing harassment at work or confronting societal issues, Stoicism teaches us to make choices based on a deep understanding of our roles and responsibilities. It's not the outcomes that define our Stoic virtue but the intention and reasoning behind our choices.\nThroughout the episode, I emphasized the importance of thoughtful deliberation and the interconnectedness of our roles within the Circles of Concern, encouraging listeners to navigate life's challenges with a Stoic mindset that values rational decision-making and the pursuit of virtue.\n--\nBecome a patron : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nCheck out Neurohacker and save : https://neurohacker.com/practical\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "title": "The Everywhere Soul",
    "date": "Mon, 15 Jan 2024 10:31:00 -0000",
    "description": "In today's episode, I delve into Book 11 of Marcus Aurelius' \"Meditations,\" focusing on a meditation (Meditations 11.1) that sheds light on the concept of service to ourselves and others. This passage from Marcus Aurelius profoundly illustrates the properties of the rational soul: it has the capacity to see and analyze itself, and to shape its own existence according to its will. What's unique about the rational soul is that it enjoys the fruits of its own actions, unlike plants and animals, whose fruits are enjoyed by others.\nI explore the idea that the rational soul reaches its own end, regardless of the lifespan of its host. This concept is intriguing because, unlike a play or dance that requires completion to be whole, the rational soul is complete and fulfilled at every moment of its existence. This completeness is intrinsic and does not depend on the duration of life.\nDiving deeper, I discussed how humans possess a level of consciousness that can interrupt the universe's rationality, creating a reality where the naturally existing rational faculty in humans must be actively leveraged for us to live in accordance with our nature. This brings us to the concept of the madman, the Prokoptôn (the one who is progressing or aspiring Stoic), and the sage. The madman is oblivious to reason and rationality, the Prokoptôn is aware and striving to align with their rational nature, and the sage is the embodiment of perfect rationality.\nI emphasized that the realization of our rational soul is a choice. We can either let our untamed consciousness overpower our true nature, or we can choose to be Prokoptôn, using our rational faculties to embody the natural reason of our soul. The rational soul, once fully realized, sees its existence as a state that cannot be improved upon and does not require additional time to validate or qualify its existence.\nFurthermore, I touched upon the interconnectedness of the rational soul with the universe. The idea that the rational soul, part of the universal reason, is connected to everything in existence implies a natural kinship with all beings and things. This perspective challenges the often misunderstood notion of Stoicism as solely a philosophy of individualism and resilience. Instead, it underscores our interconnectedness with the universe and all its inhabitants, urging us to value the universal rational soul and, by extension, everything in existence.\nIn closing, I invited listeners to reflect on how this discussion might alter their understanding of Stoicism and to share their thoughts. This episode aimed to bring to light the deeper, more spiritual aspects of Stoicism, moving beyond the popular interpretations to explore its profound universal implications.\n--\nBecome a Patron : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nCheck out Neurohacker and save : https://neurohacker.com/practical\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "date": "Fri, 12 Jan 2024 10:00:00 -0000",
    "description": "I had an insightful discussion with Will Johncock about his book, \"Beyond the Individual.\" Will explored the themes of Stoicism, particularly how it emphasizes community and connection rather than just individualism. As a philosopher and academic, he delved into Stoicism's perspectives on individualism and collectivism, highlighting the importance of understanding where we as individuals end and where the rest of the world begins.\nHe discussed his academic journey, noting how he became interested in Stoicism during his graduate studies in philosophy and sociology. Will explained the concept of Oikeiôsis, emphasizing the Stoic belief in the interconnectedness of all beings and the shared mind. This concept challenges the modern interpretations of Stoicism that focus heavily on individual resilience and self-improvement. Instead, Will's approach highlights the Stoic view of our social nature and responsibilities to others.\nThe podcast also touched on practical applications of Stoic principles in modern life, like parenting and education. Will argued for incorporating Stoic values in early education to foster a sense of community and connectedness from a young age. He addressed the challenges posed by contemporary individualistic interpretations of Stoicism, advocating for a more nuanced and traditional understanding of the philosophy.\nFor those interested in exploring these themes further, Will Johncock's book \"Beyond the Individual\" offers a detailed and accessible exploration of Stoicism's focus on community and connection. The book is available for purchase online, and it provides a fresh perspective on Stoic philosophy, challenging some of the more individualistic interpretations prevalent today.\n--\nBecome a Patron : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nCheck out Neurohacker and save : https://neurohacker.com/practical\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "date": "Mon, 08 Jan 2024 10:00:00 -0000",
    "description": "This episode of \"Practical Stoicism\" delves into the concept of Oikeiôsis, focusing on how to identify the aspects of life one should actively concern themselves with. I emphasize the distinction between caring about something and actively concerning oneself with it. Drawing from Stoic philosophy, the episode unfolds in four steps:\n#1 - Realize that you're human: Acknowledging that my most proximal concerns must be for ourselves and other humans. The Stoic perspective asserts that our ethical concerns must follow this order: self > family > friends > community > humanity > non-human animals > biosphere\n#2 - Identify your strengths, weaknesses: Recognizing our strengths and weaknesses to make informed choices about where to direct our concerns. This involves assessing whether we are financially, physically, or mentally equipped to engage in specific actions.\n#3 - Identify the roles you cannot unchoose: Recognizing roles and responsibilities that are inherent, non-negotiable, or arise from our choices. Balancing these roles with new concerns to ensure harmony and avoid abandoning essential responsibilities.\n#4 - Choose what you want: Empowered to freely choose concerns based on personal desires, keeping in mind the logical and rational defense developed through previous steps. This step ensures that our choices align with our strengths, limitations, and existing roles.\nThe episode concludes with the freedom to choose without shame, armed with a rational understanding of personal limitations and priorities. The host encourages listeners to share their chosen concerns on Spotify, fostering a community of inspiration and diverse perspectives.\n--\nBecome a patron of this podcast : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nCheck out Neurohacker and save : https://neurohacker.com/practical\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "description": "In today's episode of Practical Stoicism, I'm thrilled to bring back Professor William Stephens for a deep dive into Oikeiôsis, the theme of this month. We delve into its ancient Stoic roots and its relevance in contemporary life, exploring how it helps us understand what is truly ours to be concerned with. Oikeiôsis, a term that signifies the recognition of what is akin or appropriate to us, extends our concern beyond ourselves to our family, community, humanity, and the entire biosphere. Professor Stephens clarifies that while Oikeiôsis is a uniquely Stoic term, its principles are universally applicable, emphasizing our interconnection with all living things and the wider world.\nOur conversation also tackles misconceptions of Stoicism, highlighting that it's not merely a life hack or a path to personal success but a profound guide for ethical living and community engagement. We discuss how Stoicism, especially through the concept of Oikeiôsis, informs our sense of justice and moral duty, urging us to consider our roles and responsibilities within the vast network of relationships that define our lives.\nAs we conclude, we touch upon the critical issue of environmental responsibility, linking the Stoic view of Oikeiôsis to contemporary concerns like global warming. This episode is a reminder that Stoicism, with its emphasis on virtue and common good, offers timeless wisdom for navigating the complexities of modern life and contributing positively to the world around us. Join us as we explore these ancient yet ever-relevant ideas and how they can inspire us to lead more thoughtful, interconnected lives.\n--\nBecome a Patron : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nWilliam's book : https://a.co/d/9U5511N\nWilliam's Santa Claus article : https://read.actualstoicism.com/p/is-santa-a-stoic\nCheck out Neurohacker and save : https://neurohacker.com/practical\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "date": "Wed, 20 Dec 2023 18:57:56 -0000",
    "description": "In this episode, I continue the discussion on ego, incorporating insights from my listeners and sharing my own reflections. After welcoming new patron Richard Herring, I note the podcast's expansion onto YouTube and the distinct approach I'm taking there.\nI dive into various listener perspectives on ego, ranging from its necessity in self-identity and decision-making to its potential dangers when overinflated. These comments highlight the complexity of ego, suggesting it's neither wholly good nor bad but rather a tool that needs careful management.\nFrom a Stoic perspective, I agree that ego is essential, especially in the context of recognizing our autonomy and ability to make choices. However, the challenge lies in balancing this self-awareness without letting ego distort our perception of reality or our capabilities.\nDrawing on psychoanalytic theory, I discuss the ego as the part of our personality that interacts with the external world, highlighting its role in our perception and decision-making processes. This understanding underscores the Stoic view that ego, while necessary, should not be allowed to dominate or misguide us.\nI then explore the balance between having enough ego to believe in our abilities and avoiding the delusion of overestimating our capabilities. Utilitarian considerations, while not strictly Stoic, play a role in our decision-making, especially in situations where our actions can have significant consequences.\nFinally, I offer three pieces of advice for keeping the ego in check:\n1 - Regularly adopting the cosmic viewpoint to gain perspective on our insignificance in the universe.\n2 - Habitually engaging with others to shift focus away from oneself.\n3 - Volunteering regularly to maintain a healthy balance between self-concern and service to others.\nThe episode concludes with a reminder to participate in the Spotify question for the upcoming episode, where we'll delve deeper into the concept of ego with a subject matter expert.\n--\nBecome a patron of this podcast : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "date": "Mon, 18 Dec 2023 09:51:16 -0000",
    "description": "Today begins a three-part series exploring ego. I question whether ego is the 'big bad boogey monster' of Vice, setting the stage for a week-long thematic exploration. \nInitially, I discuss a meditation from Marcus Aurelius, which, although not explicitly about ego (since the concept didn't exist in his time), relates to the idea of self-importance.\nI note the difference between the everyday use of 'ego' and its clinical or scientific definitions. The colloquial understanding often equates ego with being overly self-important or pompous.\nMarcus Aurelius' meditation (5.24) provides a Stoic perspective, urging us to consider our insignificance in the grand scheme of the universe. This viewpoint is a direct challenge to the ego-centric view, emphasizing how minuscule our existence is compared to the vastness of matter, time, and historical events.\nMy interpretation of Marcus' message is not to push us towards Nihilism but rather to offer a cosmic perspective that helps temper ego-driven thoughts. This Stoic approach aims to provide a reality check to our self-importance, reminding us that we're not the center of the universe. This acknowledgment doesn't mean our lives are meaningless, but it suggests that we should keep our ego in check to maintain a balanced perspective.\nMy goal with this series is to thoroughly explore the concept of ego, providing practical advice and insights that listeners can apply in their daily lives. By the end of the week, the aim is to have a comprehensive understanding of ego and how it relates to the pursuit of virtue in Stoicism. \n--\nBecome a Patron : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nJoin the Discord : https://discord.gg/stoicism\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "description": "In this episode of \"Practical Stoicism,\" I delve into the intriguing concept of the Daimon in Stoic philosophy, an aspect I find less central to my practice but immensely significant. The discussion navigates the nuanced parallels between Stoicism and religious or deeply spiritual practices, underscoring the varied approaches to Stoic practice - from everyday practical applications to more devout, monk-like dedication.\nThe core of the episode revolves around understanding the Daimon as our guiding spirit or conscience, likened to a fragment of the divine or Nature, steering us toward good. This exploration involves dissecting Marcus Aurelius's views on living harmoniously with the gods and the Daimon. I unravel the common misinterpretations of Marcus's teachings, emphasizing that following the Daimon isn't merely about \"listening to your heart\" in a new-age sense, but involves a deeper, rational introspection.\nFurthermore, the episode addresses the challenge of understanding Stoicism with only a fraction of its ancient texts available. This limited access calls for caution against dogmatic views and highlights the importance of maintaining an open, agnostic approach to Stoic teachings.\nReturning to the Daimon, I stress that it's not about passive acceptance of life's lot, but actively engaging with our inner drive as directed by the Daimon. This involves discerning and pursuing what is genuinely meaningful, despite external opinions or internal doubts. The episode illustrates this through personal reflections on pursuing passions and life choices, guided by the Daimon.\nIn essence, this episode brings to light the practical aspects of engaging with the Daimon in Stoicism, encouraging listeners to embrace their inner guide towards living a fulfilling and virtuous life.\n--\nSupport my work directly on Patreon : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nSubscribe to my Everyday Stoicism blog : https://everydaystoicism.com\nJoin the Actual Stoicism discord community : https://stoicismpod.com/discord\n--\nOnline copy of Meditations (A.S.L Farquharson) : https://link.stoicismpod.com/farquharson\nOnline copy of Enchiridion (Elizabeth Carter) : https://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html\n--\nArtwork by\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "description": "In this episode, I engage in a thought-provoking conversation with Professor Christopher Gill of the University of Exeter. As a renowned scholar in Ancient Thought and author of several influential books, including the recent \"Learning to Live Naturally,\" Professor Gill shares his deep insights into Stoicism. Our discussion centers on Stoic Compatibilism, Nature, Free Will, and Autonomy, offering a unique perspective on these classical concepts.\nProfessor Gill elaborates on the Stoic view of universal causal determinism and how it coexists with human autonomy and rationality. He emphasizes that adult humans, unlike other beings, possess the ability to make rational choices, setting them apart in the deterministic framework of the universe. The conversation also addresses common misconceptions about Stoicism, particularly the notion of fatalism.\nA highlight of our discussion is Professor Gill's explanation of the Stoic interpretation of free will and autonomy, which differs significantly from modern concepts. He clarifies the Stoic stance on determinism and responsibility, illustrating how past experiences and actions shape our decisions, yet we remain the architects of our destiny through the character we develop.\nAdditionally, Professor Gill discusses his latest book, shedding light on core Stoic ethics, the process of learning to live in accordance with nature, and Stoicism's relevance to contemporary ethical challenges, including environmentalism.\nThis episode not only deepens the understanding of Stoicism but also connects ancient philosophy to modern-day contexts, making it a must-listen for anyone interested in the intersection of ancient wisdom and contemporary thought.\n--\nSupport my work directly on Patreon : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nSubscribe to my Everyday Stoicism blog : https://everydaystoicism.com\nJoin the Actual Stoicism discord community : https://stoicismpod.com/discord\n--\nOnline copy of Meditations (A.S.L Farquharson) : https://link.stoicismpod.com/farquharson\nOnline copy of Enchiridion (Elizabeth Carter) : https://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "description": "In this episode of \"Practical Stoicism,\" I delve into Enchiridion 10, a personal favorite, which prompts us to consider how we can use our abilities to properly handle different situations in life. The core message revolves around transforming life's challenges into opportunities for practicing virtues like self-restraint, fortitude, and patience.\nI candidly share my own struggles and complaints, such as dealing with a complicated emigration process, to illustrate how easy it is to fall into the trap of blaming circumstances or external factors for our problems. However, I've noticed a significant decrease in my own complaining since starting this podcast, indicating a shift in my approach to life's challenges.\nI liken life's journey to the animated travel paths in old cartoons, specifically referencing \"Duck Dodgers.\" These journeys, filled with twists, turns, and occasional collisions, symbolize the times we navigate through life, reflecting and learning about virtue and character. It's in these moments, like arguments with loved ones or facing personal challenges, that we have the chance to apply our theoretical musings about virtue to real-life situations.\nEpictetus, I believe, suggests that these challenging moments are necessary for testing and applying our virtues. Without these 'nexus points,' we wouldn't have the opportunity to demonstrate our character and growth. It's not about craving misfortune, but rather recognizing and embracing these events as chances to prove and improve ourselves.\nI conclude by emphasizing the importance of perspective in dealing with life's adversities. How we respond to these situations, like the loss of a beloved pet, can either reveal weaknesses or strengths in our character. It's about choosing to see these incidents as opportunities to define our path, rather than as mere setbacks. This mindset shift is crucial for personal growth and aligning closer to the ideals of Stoicism.\n--\nSupport my work directly on Patreon : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nSubscribe to my Everyday Stoicism blog : https://everydaystoicism.com\nJoin the Actual Stoicism discord community : https://stoicismpod.com/discord\n--\nOnline copy of Meditations (A.S.L Farquharson) : https://link.stoicismpod.com/farquharson\nOnline copy of Enchiridion (Elizabeth Carter) : https://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "date": "Mon, 04 Dec 2023 17:00:00 -0000",
    "description": "Today's episode features Meditations 5.26. I delve into the profound teachings of Marcus Aurelius, focusing on the importance of maintaining rational control over bodily afflictions. Marcus advises us to accept natural sensations like pain without labeling them as good or bad. He emphasizes the need to avoid letting physical discomforts, such as pain from minor injuries, overwhelm our rational faculties. This concept resonates with me personally, as I share an ongoing struggle to manage my anger towards someone who, despite not harming me in a Stoic sense, has greatly upset me. \nI explore the difficulty of practicing Stoic teachings in real life, acknowledging the challenge of not holding grudges or judging others harshly for their actions. Reflecting on Seneca's wisdom about the universality of human error and the importance of forgiveness, I discuss how holding onto anger can be more harmful to ourselves than to others. I recommend a pragmatic approach: giving ourselves space and time to process our feelings before confronting the source of our anger. This method may not be strictly Stoic, but it is a practical way to handle intense emotions, ensuring we don't react in ways that could escalate conflicts or harm relationships.\nThank you for joining me on this journey of self-reflection and philosophical exploration. Remember, if you're dealing with anger, it's okay to take a step back and give yourself time to cool off.\n--\nSupport my work directly on Patreon : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nSubscribe to my Everyday Stoicism blog : https://everydaystoicism.com\nJoin the Actual Stoicism discord community : https://stoicismpod.com/discord\n--\nOnline copy of Meditations (A.S.L Farquharson) : https://link.stoicismpod.com/farquharson\nOnline copy of Enchiridion (Elizabeth Carter) : https://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "description": "In this episode of \"Practical Stoicism,\" I delve into the profound teachings of Enchiridion 9, a text that compellingly explores the concept of freedom of choice. The irony isn't lost on me that we're discussing this topic, especially as we anticipate introducing the third guest in our series soon.\nEnchiridion 9 teaches us that our physical conditions, like sickness or lameness, do not impede our ability to choose. This wisdom comes from a former slave who experienced physical torment firsthand, urging us to realize that our choices, not our circumstances, define us.\nI take this opportunity to question the very essence of how we perceive experiences and their impact on us. For instance, if being robbed makes us live in fear of a repeat incident, is it the event itself or our irrational fear that shapes this reaction? I also extend this discussion to the concept of psychological trauma, which I'm starting to see as a series of unchecked, illogical choices that solidify into behaviors. This perspective might be contentious, but it's vital to explore how our choices, rather than experiences, mold us.\nOur discussion then shifts to the role of experiences in shaping our character. While they offer opportunities to make choices, they don't necessarily constrain us - only our decisions can do that. I relate this to a video game concept where choices impact a character's appearance, symbolizing how actions, more than circumstances, define our moral and ethical makeup.\nFinally, I examine how circumstances influence our choices, using the example of stealing out of necessity. I argue that even in dire situations, our choices, guided by virtue or vice, are paramount. In Stoicism, the pursuit of virtue is the ultimate goal, transcending even the instinct for survival.\nIn conclusion, this episode underscores that in the realm of Stoic philosophy, it's always our choices, not our experiences or circumstances, that hold the true power.\n--\nGet the lifetime ad-free deal : https://stoicismpod.com/lifetime\n--\nSupport my work directly on Patreon : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nSubscribe to my Everyday Stoicism blog : https://everydaystoicism.com\nJoin the Actual Stoicism discord community : https://stoicismpod.com/discord\n--\nOnline copy of Meditations (A.S.L Farquharson) : https://link.stoicismpod.com/farquharson\nOnline copy of Enchiridion (Elizabeth Carter) : https://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "title": "Character And Action In The Face Of Wrongdoing",
    "date": "Tue, 28 Nov 2023 21:30:00 -0000",
    "description": "Today's episode takes a deep dive into a particularly challenging meditation from Marcus Aurelius – Meditation 25 from Book 5. This meditation, often misinterpreted, addresses how we should respond to the wrongdoings of others. It reads: \"Another does wrong. What is that to me? Let him look to it; he has his own disposition, his own activity. I have now what Universal Nature wills me to have, and I do what my own nature wills me to do.\"\nAt first glance, this might seem like Marcus is suggesting we ignore the misdeeds of others as they are none of our business. However, this interpretation misses the point. Instead, Marcus is guiding us to focus on our own character and actions, especially when confronted with wrongdoing.\nThe real question is not about the character of the wrongdoer, but about our own. As witnesses to an act of wrongdoing, our reaction speaks volumes about our character. For instance, if you're a police officer and witness domestic violence, your response is a direct reflection of your character. But what if you're just a bystander on public transit? Is it still your concern? Yes, because how you respond – whether you choose to intervene or not – reveals your own virtue or vice.\nThe key takeaway from Marcus' meditation is the importance of discerning our role in each situation. Whether we're a bartender, a priest, an off-duty cop, or a student, our roles and attributes should guide our actions. It's not always about physical strength or confrontation; sometimes, it's about offering help in a way that aligns with our unique strengths and roles.\nIn sum, Marcus Aurelius isn't telling us to ignore evil; he's reminding us to focus on what we can control – our own character and actions – and to act virtuously when faced with wrongdoing, not for others' sake, but for our own.\n--\nGet the lifetime ad-free deal : https://stoicismpod.com/lifetime\n--\nSupport my work directly on Patreon : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nSubscribe to my Everyday Stoicism blog : https://everydaystoicism.com\nJoin the Actual Stoicism discord community : https://stoicismpod.com/discord\n--\nOnline copy of Meditations (A.S.L Farquharson) : https://link.stoicismpod.com/farquharson\nOnline copy of Enchiridion (Elizabeth Carter) : https://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "date": "Fri, 24 Nov 2023 15:09:50 -0000",
    "description": "In this podcast episode, myself and guest Dr. William O. Stephens, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at Creighton University, delve into the concept of free will in Stoicism, defined as \"uninhibited freedom of choice.\" Initially, I share my emotional response to criticisms received on a previous episode about free will. Recognizing my response as un-Stoic, I offer an apology and clarify my views, emphasizing my responsibility in presenting Stoicism accurately, especially to the young and impressionable audience.\nDr. Stephens and I explore whether Stoicism supports the idea of free will. We discuss the Stoic view of the universe as a blend of fate and individual agency, emphasizing that Stoicism is not deterministic but compatibilist - it allows for free will within a framework of causal determinism. This perspective aligns with my understanding of free will in Stoicism, which I define as the ability to make one's own choices, free from external coercion.\nWe delve into Stoic psychology and the concept of 'lecta' (sayables or propositions) and how these relate to human decision-making. Dr. Stephens explains that while Stoics believe in fate, they also maintain that individuals have the freedom of ascent, the ability to agree or disagree with presented propositions, thus exercising free choice.\nThe episode also touches upon different philosophical positions regarding determinism and free will: hard determinism, soft determinism (compatibilism), and libertarianism. We establish that Stoics are compatibilists who believe in both causal determinism and human freedom to choose, making them morally responsible for their actions.\nA significant part of our discussion revolves around the Stoic concept of 'prohairesis' (faculty of choice or volition), particularly in the teachings of Epictetus. This faculty is central to Stoic ethics, embodying the idea that our choices and decisions define us.\nWe also address misconceptions about Stoicism being fatalistic, using examples like the 'lazy argument' to illustrate how Stoics view the role of human agency in a predetermined universe. Additionally, we discuss the Stoic doctrine of eternal return and its relevance (or lack thereof) to Stoic ethics and individual freedom.\nIn conclusion, Dr. Stephens and I affirm that freedom of choice is a crucial component of Stoicism. This episode reaffirms my commitment to Stoicism and its practical application in modern life, regardless of minor differences in interpreting some of its ancient doctrines.\n--\nSupport my work directly on Patreon : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nSubscribe to my Everyday Stoicism blog : https://everydaystoicism.com\nJoin the Actual Stoicism discord community : https://stoicismpod.com/discord\n--\nOnline copy of Meditations (A.S.L Farquharson) : https://link.stoicismpod.com/farquharson\nOnline copy of Enchiridion (Elizabeth Carter) : https://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "title": "Free Will: Stop Denying It",
    "date": "Wed, 22 Nov 2023 07:36:52 -0000",
    "description": "In this episode, I explore the complex topic of free will, particularly through the lens of Stoicism and its modern interpretations. I begin by defining free will as our capacity to act, think, or behave in ways that aren't predetermined by past events. I delve into Sam Harris's book \"Free Will,\" which posits that our brains make decisions before we're consciously aware of them, challenging the existence of free will. However, I argue against this perspective, suggesting instead that the brain develops cognitive shortcuts for decision-making, a concept that aligns with Stoic philosophy.\nI then shift the discussion to the potential dangers of embracing determinism or the absence of free will, especially for young people. I express my concerns that such beliefs can lead to nihilism and morally dubious actions, as they imply our choices are predestined and meaningless. I emphasize the importance of upholding the idea of free will to prevent societal and character degradation.\nI critique the deterministic view of the ancient Stoics, who believed that everything, including our choices, is predestined. I find this view contradictory to the essential Stoic principle of making virtuous choices. I also discuss and dismiss the concept of 'co-fating' introduced by the ancient Stoic philosopher Chrysippus as circular reasoning.\nAfter a brief pause, I present my theory: fate exists but is suspended in the human mind. I argue that while time and inanimate objects are fated, conscious beings, particularly humans, can act independently of fate due to their concentrated 'logos' or reasoning power. This theory suggests that while the universe (fate) moves forward in time, we, as humans, can make independent choices.\nIn conclusion, I affirm that Stoicism remains a valuable philosophy, albeit one that needs to be interpreted in the context of contemporary knowledge and science. I propose that practicing Stoicism can foster the development of cognitive shortcuts for making virtuous choices, thus aligning our actions with nature. I end the episode by reaffirming Stoicism's relevance and acknowledging the limitations of ancient Stoic philosophers in grasping concepts beyond their scientific understanding.\n--\nSupport my work directly on Patreon : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nSubscribe to my Everyday Stoicism blog : https://everydaystoicism.com\nJoin the Actual Stoicism discord community : https://stoicismpod.com/discord\n--\nOnline copy of Meditations (A.S.L Farquharson) : https://link.stoicismpod.com/farquharson\nOnline copy of Enchiridion (Elizabeth Carter) : https://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Marcus prompts us to acknowledge our tiny role in the grand chain of causation, reminding us of our shared substance with the cosmos. This meditation serves as a humbling yet empowering reflection on our place in the world.

Today we’re jumping into letter 80 of Seneca’s moral letters to Lucilius.\n\"To-day I have some free time, thanks not so much to myself as to the games, which have attracted all the bores to the boxing-match. No one will interrupt me or disturb the train of my thoughts, which go ahead more boldly as the result of my very confidence. My door has not been continually creaking on its hinges nor will my curtain be pulled aside; my thoughts may march safely on, – and that is all the more necessary for one who goes independently and follows out his own path. Do I then follow no predecessors? Yes, but I allow myself to discover something new, to alter, to reject. I am not a slave to them, although I give them my approval.\"\n--\nGet rid of ads and support our work : https://link.stoicismpod.com/members\nHang out with us in our free listener community: https://link.stoicismpod.com/discord\nJoin our daily Stoic journaling program : https://link.stoicismpod.com/journaling\nJoin our Stoic mentoring community : https://link.stoicismpod.com/path \n--\nView a list of our sponsors : https://link.stoicismpod.com/sponsors\n--\nVisit our website : https://stoicismpod.com\nCheck out our reading list : https://stoicismpod.com/suggested-reading\nRead our articles : https://stoicismpod.com/category/articles\n--\nOnline copy of Meditations (Long) : https://link.stoicismpod.com/meditations-long\nOnline copy of Meditations (Casaubon) : https://link.stoicismpod.com/meditations-casaubon\nOnline copy of Seneca's Letters : https://link.stoicismpod.com/letters\n--\nLearn more about your ad choices.

    "date": "Wed, 19 Oct 2022 09:00:00 -0000",
    "description": "Many listeners have written in expressing difficulty in accepting death and reframing it as the Stoics framed it. So, in today's episode, I speak with Professor of Classics at Bard University and author of \"How to Die: An Ancient Guide to the End of Life\" and \"Dying Every Day, Seneca at the Court of Nero.\" During our conversation, James shares much about Seneca's life with me, and much about why overcoming death is critical to living a good life.
