  Today's episode takes a deep dive into a particularly challenging meditation
  from Marcus Aurelius – Meditation 25 from Book 5. This meditation, often
  misinterpreted, addresses how we should respond to the wrongdoings of others.
  It reads: "Another does wrong. What is that to me? Let him look to it; he has
  his own disposition, his own activity. I have now what Universal Nature wills
  me to have, and I do what my own nature wills me to do."

  At first glance, this might seem like Marcus is suggesting we ignore the
  misdeeds of others as they are none of our business. However, this
  interpretation misses the point. Instead, Marcus is guiding us to focus on our
  own character and actions, especially when confronted with wrongdoing.

  The real question is not about the character of the wrongdoer, but about our
  own. As witnesses to an act of wrongdoing, our reaction speaks volumes about
  our character. For instance, if you're a police officer and witness domestic
  violence, your response is a direct reflection of your character. But what if
  you're just a bystander on public transit? Is it still your concern? Yes,
  because how you respond – whether you choose to intervene or not – reveals
  your own virtue or vice.

  The key takeaway from Marcus' meditation is the importance of discerning our
  role in each situation. Whether we're a bartender, a priest, an off-duty cop,
  or a student, our roles and attributes should guide our actions. It's not
  always about physical strength or confrontation; sometimes, it's about
  offering help in a way that aligns with our unique strengths and roles.

  In sum, Marcus Aurelius isn't telling us to ignore evil; he's reminding us to
  focus on what we can control – our own character and actions – and to act
  virtuously when faced with wrongdoing, not for others' sake, but for our own.
