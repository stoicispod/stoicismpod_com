title: Breaking Bad Habits And Habituating Good Ones
date: Fri, 29 Mar 2024 09:00:00 -0000
description: >-
  In this practical episode of "Practical Stoicism," I delve into the critical
  art of forming good habits, a cornerstone of personal growth and
  self-improvement. Starting with a deep dive into the nature of bad
  habits—those that are not chemical addictions or compulsions but rather result
  from habituated choices—I draw from the profound insights of Epictetus on the
  realms of choice and control.

  I emphasize that our actions and behaviors are within our grasp, aiming to
  guide you through the transformative process of becoming your best self by
  making deliberate choices. By clearly distinguishing between what is within
  our control and what is not, I set the stage for overcoming undesirable
  habits.

  With wisdom from Chrysippus and practical strategies for reshaping our
  behavior, this episode offers a Stoic roadmap to replace chronic behaviors
  with virtuous habits, guiding you on a transformative journey towards
  self-discipline and enlightened character development.
