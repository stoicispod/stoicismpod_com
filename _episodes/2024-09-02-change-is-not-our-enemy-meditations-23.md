title: Change is not our enemy (Meditations 2.3)
date: Mon, 02 Sep 2024 09:00:00 -0000
description: >-
  In this episode, we delve into Meditation 2.3 of Marcus Aurelius’s
  Meditations. We explore the concepts of Providence and the interconnectedness
  of the universe as understood by the Stoics. We discuss how everything in the
  cosmos, including human life, is part of a logical and stable system governed
  by natural laws. Additionally, we touch upon the Stoic view of change and how
  it contributes to the stability of the universe. The practical takeaway?
  Embrace the logical nature of the cosmos, understand that change is not our
  enemy but rather a necessary aspect of existence, and remember that the answer
  to a contented life doesn’t lie in external sources like books or gurus but in
  accepting and playing our part in the grand scheme of things.

  Quoted Meditation:

  “The work of the gods is full of Providence: the work of Fortune is not
  divorced from Nature or the spinning and winding of the threads ordained by
  Providence. All flows from that other world; and there is, besides, necessity
  and the wellbeing of the whole universe, whereof you are a part. Now to every
  part of Nature that is good which the nature of the Whole brings, and which
  preserves that nature; and the whole world is preserved as much by the changes
  of the compound bodies as by the changes of the elements which compose those
  bodies. Let this be sufficient for you, these be continually your doctrines.
  But put away your thirst for books, that so you may not die murmuring, but
  truly reconciled and grateful from your heart to the gods.” — Meditations, 2.3
