title: Habituation and the Practice of Stoic Virtue (Meditations 2.10)
date: Mon, 21 Oct 2024 09:00:00 -0000
description: >-
  In this episode, I cover Meditation 10 from Book 2 of Meditations, where
  Marcus Aurelius reflects on the comparison between faults driven by anger and
  those driven by desire. He references Theophrastus, who argued that errors
  rooted in pleasure and appetite are graver than those caused by anger. I
  explore this idea, explaining how Stoics view actions driven by desire as more
  deliberate and habituated than those caused by reactive emotions like anger.
  When we act out of anger, it is often a response to external stimuli, a
  proto-emotion that we can manage. However, when driven by pleasure, it is a
  deeper habituation that reflects ongoing indulgence in vice, making it harder
  to correct.

  I also discuss the translation issues around the term "effeminate," which
  appears in some versions of this meditation. I explain how the term used in
  Greek more accurately means "morally weak" rather than a critique of
  femininity. Marcus’ message is not about gender but about the danger of
  succumbing to our desires without rational consideration, a habit that can
  lead to greater moral failings over time.

  The episode further delves into the concept of habituation as a critical Stoic
  tool. I emphasize that Stoicism is not just a philosophy but a practice that
  requires repeated, deliberate actions. Through consistent practice, our
  responses to situations become reflexive, turning virtuous behavior into a
  habit. This is why true Stoic progress involves moving beyond conscious effort
  to a stage where virtue becomes second nature, a goal that even I am still
  striving to achieve.

  "Like a true philosopher Theophrastus says, when comparing, as men commonly do
  compare, various faults, errors of appetite are graver than errors of temper.
  For clearly one who loses his temper is turning away from Reason with a kind
  of pain and inward spasm; whereas he who offends through appetite is the
  victim of pleasure and is clearly more vicious in a way and more effeminate in
  his wrong-doing." - Meditations 2.10
