  Tanner Campbell converses with Michael Tremblay, an MMA fighter, writer, and
  co-creator of Stoa Stoic Meditations app. They delve into several topics,
  including the role of sport and exercise in addressing rage and anger.

  Michael Tremblay shares his insights on the practice of martial arts,
  particularly Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and its philosophical alignment with
  Stoicism. He emphasizes how martial arts were his first exposure to explicit
  moral education, teaching not just physical skills but also the importance of
  character development, self-control, and ethical behavior.

  Discussing anger, Tremblay highlights the Stoic perspective, as outlined by
  Seneca, which views anger as a reaction to perceived harm that demands
  punishment. He distinguishes between two types of anger: the immediate,
  reactionary kind often experienced in daily frustrations, and a deeper, more
  persistent anger stemming from significant personal betrayals or grievances.

  Tremblay notes that while physical activities like martial arts can
  effectively mitigate the immediate, reactionary anger, they are less effective
  in addressing deeper, long-standing feelings of rage or betrayal. He explains
  how Stoicism helps navigate these emotions by encouraging a present-focused
  mindset, acknowledging past mistakes while striving to change and improve.

  In dealing with regret, Tremblay and Campbell agree that while Stoicism
  advocates for acceptance and moving forward, it also acknowledges the natural
  feelings of sadness and shame that come with regret. They underscore the
  importance of understanding and transforming these feelings constructively,
  focusing on the present and future actions rather than dwelling on past
  errors.

  The conversation also touches upon Epictetus, his background as a slave, and
  his philosophical teachings. Tremblay provides insights into Epictetus's
  approach to teaching young Roman men destined for politics or industry,
  emphasizing the importance of not just learning philosophy but living it.

  In summary, the podcast highlights the value of physical disciplines like
  martial arts in managing immediate anger and stress, while recognizing the
  need for philosophical reflection and self-improvement in addressing deeper
  emotional issues. The discussion reinforces the Stoic principles of focusing
  on present actions, accepting the past, and continually striving for personal
  growth and ethical living.
