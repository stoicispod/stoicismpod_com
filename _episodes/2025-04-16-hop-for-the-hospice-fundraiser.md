  This spring, Cailean is putting on his bunny ears and joining his nursery
  friends in a very special hopping challenge—Hop for Hospice—to help raise
  vital funds for Thames Hospice.

  Cailean is just one year old, but even at this young age, he’s taking his
  first steps (or hops!) toward making a difference in the lives of others. With
  your support, every bounce, wiggle, and hop he takes will help ensure that
  Thames Hospice can continue providing specialist care to those facing
  life-limiting illnesses in our community.


  Thames Hospice offers free, compassionate, end-of-life care to individuals and
  families across East Berkshire and South Buckinghamshire. Their work is only
  possible through fundraising efforts like this one. The hospice must raise
  £34,000 every single day to keep their services running. That’s where
  Cailean—and you—come in.


  If you’re able to support his hopping efforts with a donation, no matter the
  size, you’ll be helping to bring expert care and everyday kindness to those
  who need it most.


  Let’s help Cailean hop big for a cause that matters. Thank you for your
  generosity.
