title: Stoicism Isn't About Equality

description: >-
  In this episode, I explore the complex relationship between Stoicism and the
  concept of equality. While the title may be partly clickbait, it also
  highlights a significant discussion on how Stoicism views equality and
  justice.

  I delve into how modern society has become disconnected from coherent moral
  reasoning, driven largely by raw emotions rather than philosophical
  principles. This episode is not an excuse to dismiss fairness or justice;
  rather, it's a call to understand these concepts through the lens of Stoic
  philosophy.

  I discuss the definition of equality as a state of being equal, especially in
  status, rights, or opportunities, and examine how practical implementation can
  become complicated. Using a hypothetical scenario about medical school
  admissions, I illustrate how well-intentioned ideas can quickly become
  complex.

  From a Stoic standpoint, I explain that you cannot please everyone and that
  individuals cannot control whether others are pleased. However, Stoicism also
  emphasizes the importance of caring about injustices and treating others
  justly and fairly.

  I address the misconception that Stoicism promotes a dismissive attitude
  towards those who suffer injustices. True Stoicism requires us to pursue
  Virtue, which involves knowing our role in the Cosmopolis, treating others
  justly, and showing appropriate concern for those within our circles.

  Listeners are challenged to consider how they respond to injustice, both when
  they witness it and when they experience it themselves. Stoicism does not
  advocate for virtue signaling or acting viciously in response to injustice.
  Instead, it calls for reasoned and virtuous choices, regardless of outcomes.

  Finally, I clarify that while Stoicism is not concerned with the outcome of
  equality, it cares deeply about the virtuous choices we make in relation to
  it. The pursuit of Virtue should guide our actions and concerns, not the
  pursuit of specific outcomes.
