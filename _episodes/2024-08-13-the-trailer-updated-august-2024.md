  Welcome to Season 2 of Practical Stoicism! When I started this podcast in
  January 2022, I knew very little about Stoicism. Fast forward to today, and
  the podcast now averages around 4 million plays a year. Along the way, I've
  written over half a million words on Stoicism, co-authored a book, and gained
  recognition as a Stoic philosopher within the academic community.

  With all this growth and learning, I realized that some of the early episodes
  of this podcast may not be as accurate or insightful as I'd like them to be
  today. Rather than delete them, I've moved all 233 of those episodes into
  Season 1, creating a clear division between where I started and where we’re
  headed now.

  So, what can you expect from Season 2?

  I've learned that most of you appreciate a mix of ancient wisdom straight from
  the source, coupled with informed interpretations on how to apply that wisdom
  in contemporary life. You’re not necessarily strict Stoics, but rather
  individuals from diverse backgrounds looking for practical insights to
  incorporate into your own life philosophies.

  In Season 2, I'll continue to provide practical Stoic advice while also diving
  deeper into the ancient theories and how they can be applied today. The
  podcast will remain a place for practical guidance, while my weekly digital
  print publication at stoicismpod.com/print will explore more advanced Stoic
  concepts for those who want to go further.

  We’re starting this new season by revisiting the Meditations of Marcus
  Aurelius, beginning with Book 2. This is a reboot, and I’m bringing all the
  knowledge I’ve gained since the podcast began.

  I hope you enjoy this refreshed journey into Stoicism. Thanks for being here.
