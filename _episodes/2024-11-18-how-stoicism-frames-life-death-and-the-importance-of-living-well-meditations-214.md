  How Stoicism Frames Life, Death, and the Importance of Living Well
  (Meditations 2.14)

description: >-
  In this episode, I examine Meditation 14 from Book 2 of Meditations, where
  Marcus Aurelius reflects on the nature of time and the present moment. Marcus
  emphasizes that we cannot lose the past, as it no longer exists, nor the
  future, as it has yet to arrive. The only thing we can truly lose is the
  present moment, which is fleeting and finite. He reminds us that regardless of
  the length of one’s life, everyone loses the same thing in death: the ability
  to exist in the present.

  This meditation encourages us to focus on the now without disregarding our
  responsibilities to others and the Cosmopolis. While the present moment is the
  only time we can act, we must also consider the impact of our actions on the
  future. A Stoic life involves planning and considering our role in society,
  rather than becoming isolated or overly focused on personal resilience.
  Marcus’ reflections also critique the tendency to reduce Stoicism to
  simplistic, individualistic ideas that ignore its foundational emphasis on
  service and community.

  "Even were you about to live three thousand years or thrice ten thousand,
  nevertheless remember this, that no one loses any other life than this which
  he is living, nor lives any other than this which he is losing. Thus the
  longest and the shortest come to the same thing. For the present is equal for
  all, and what is passing is therefore equal: thus what is being lost is proved
  to be barely a moment. For a man could lose neither past nor future; how can
  one rob him of what he has not got? Always remember, then, these two things:
  one, that all things from everlasting are of the same kind, and are in
  rotation; and it matters nothing whether it be for a hundred years or for two
  hundred or for an infinite time that a man shall behold the same spectacle;
  the other, that the longest-lived and the soonest to die have an equal loss;
  for it is the present alone of which either will be deprived, since (as we
  saw) this is all he has and a man does not lose what he has not got." -
