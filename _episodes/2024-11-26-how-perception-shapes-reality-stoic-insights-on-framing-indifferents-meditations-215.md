  How Perception Shapes Reality: Stoic Insights on Framing Indifferents
  (Meditations 2.15)
date: Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:45:22 -0000
description: >-
  In this episode, I reflect on Meditation 15 from Book 2 of Meditations, where
  Marcus Aurelius emphasizes that “all is opinion.” This principle, shared by
  the Cynic philosopher Monimus, suggests that our perception defines our
  reality. While this concept is intuitive, its true power lies in recognizing
  the control we have over how we frame our experiences. By adjusting our
  perceptions, we can transform how we respond to life’s challenges, even in
  situations of profound loss or injustice.

  I explore how framing can help us endure grief, such as the death of a loved
  one, whether it occurs naturally or through tragic circumstances like a
  murder. While emotional responses are natural, Marcus reminds us that we
  always have the power to choose how we think about such events. Viewing loss
  as part of Nature’s causal chain rather than as an unfair tragedy helps us
  avoid bitterness and remain aligned with virtue. This ability to reframe
  events extends beyond personal loss, shaping how we navigate disagreements,
  relationships, and our roles within the Cosmopolis.

  "Remember that all is opinion. For what was said by the Cynic Monimus is
  manifest: and manifest too is the use of what was said, if a man receives what
  may be got out of it as far as it is true." - Meditations 2.15
