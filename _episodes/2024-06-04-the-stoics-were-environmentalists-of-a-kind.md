title: The Stoics Were Environmentalists (Of A Kind)
date: Tue, 04 Jun 2024 09:00:00 -0000
description: >-
  In this episode, I discuss the relationship between Stoicism and environmental
  responsibility. I emphasize that caring for the environment is not a political
  issue but a fundamental aspect of Stoic philosophy.

  I explore the Stoic belief in living in harmony with Nature, highlighting that
  Stoicism requires us to make morally just choices that respect the natural
  world. I explain that freedom, according to the Stoics, is the discipline to
  make virtuous choices that align with Nature's order.

  I challenge listeners to consider their personal impact on the environment,
  such as the necessity of driving heavily polluting vehicles and the
  environmental cost of importing exotic foods out of season. Drawing from Stoic
  teachings, I urge prioritizing rational and ethical behavior over personal
  convenience and luxury.

  This episode encourages reflection on how to reconcile actions with Stoic
  values and make thoughtful, virtue-driven decisions regarding environmental
  issues.
