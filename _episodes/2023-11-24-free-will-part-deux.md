description: >-
  In this podcast episode, myself and guest Dr. William O. Stephens, Professor
  Emeritus of Philosophy at Creighton University, delve into the concept of free
  will in Stoicism, defined as "uninhibited freedom of choice." Initially, I
  share my emotional response to criticisms received on a previous episode about
  free will. Recognizing my response as un-Stoic, I offer an apology and clarify
  my views, emphasizing my responsibility in presenting Stoicism accurately,
  especially to the young and impressionable audience.

  Dr. Stephens and I explore whether Stoicism supports the idea of free will. We
  discuss the Stoic view of the universe as a blend of fate and individual
  agency, emphasizing that Stoicism is not deterministic but compatibilist - it
  allows for free will within a framework of causal determinism. This
  perspective aligns with my understanding of free will in Stoicism, which I
  define as the ability to make one's own choices, free from external coercion.

  We delve into Stoic psychology and the concept of 'lecta' (sayables or
  propositions) and how these relate to human decision-making. Dr. Stephens
  explains that while Stoics believe in fate, they also maintain that
  individuals have the freedom of ascent, the ability to agree or disagree with
  presented propositions, thus exercising free choice.

  The episode also touches upon different philosophical positions regarding
  determinism and free will: hard determinism, soft determinism (compatibilism),
  and libertarianism. We establish that Stoics are compatibilists who believe in
  both causal determinism and human freedom to choose, making them morally
  responsible for their actions.

  A significant part of our discussion revolves around the Stoic concept of
  'prohairesis' (faculty of choice or volition), particularly in the teachings
  of Epictetus. This faculty is central to Stoic ethics, embodying the idea that
  our choices and decisions define us.

  We also address misconceptions about Stoicism being fatalistic, using examples
  like the 'lazy argument' to illustrate how Stoics view the role of human
  agency in a predetermined universe. Additionally, we discuss the Stoic
  doctrine of eternal return and its relevance (or lack thereof) to Stoic ethics
  and individual freedom.

  In conclusion, Dr. Stephens and I affirm that freedom of choice is a crucial
  component of Stoicism. This episode reaffirms my commitment to Stoicism and
  its practical application in modern life, regardless of minor differences in
  interpreting some of its ancient doctrines.
