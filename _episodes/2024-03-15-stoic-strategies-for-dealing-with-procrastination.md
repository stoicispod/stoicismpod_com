title: Stoic Strategies For Dealing With Procrastination

description: >-
  In today's episode, I delve into the pervasive issue of procrastination, a
  mental health symptom that seems to afflict us all in various degrees. From
  the stress of not being able to afford housing to the pressures of societal
  expectations, procrastination can manifest in many forms.

  The Stoics, with their practical philosophy, offered a solution to
  procrastination through the concept of Memento Mori, or "remember that you
  must die." By confronting our mortality, we're reminded of the limited time we
  have and are encouraged to act accordingly. However, as I explore in the
  episode, simply reminding ourselves of death doesn't always translate into
  action.

  We discuss the societal obsession with productivity and the relentless pursuit
  of efficiency, which often leads to burnout and anxiety. Despite our efforts
  to maximize productivity, we find ourselves trapped in a cycle of endless
  tasks and obligations, with little time for genuine relaxation or
  self-reflection.

  But there's a way out of this cycle. By redefining our priorities and
  embracing a mindset focused on virtue rather than productivity, we can reclaim
  control of our time and lives. This involves recognizing the inherent value of
  rest, leisure, and personal fulfillment, rather than constantly striving for
  external measures of success.

  Ultimately, the key lies in two practices: Memento Mori, as a gentle reminder
  of life's finite nature, and the creation of a plan to guide our actions and
  priorities. With these tools, we can navigate the complexities of modern life
  with clarity and purpose, free from the burden of endless productivity.
