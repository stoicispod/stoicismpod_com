title: Coffee Mugs, Loss, and Death
date: Fri, 07 Jan 2022 21:33:00 -0000
description: "If you came across Stoicism in the early 2010's (as I did) you likely heard something about a coffee mug shattering into a million pieces and how you could use this analogy to deal with death and loss. That probably didn't make a lot sense to you at first - it may have even seemed insane. There's something to this caffeinate analogy, though - and there's something practical we can extract from it to apply in our daily lives.\n--\nGet rid of ads and support our work :\_https://link.stoicismpod.com/members\nHang out with us in our free listener community:\_https://link.stoicismpod.com/discord\nJoin our daily Stoic journaling program :\_https://link.stoicismpod.com/journaling\nJoin our Stoic mentoring community :\_https://link.stoicismpod.com/path\_\n--\nView a list of our sponsors :\_https://link.stoicismpod.com/sponsors\n--\nVisit our website :\_https://stoicismpod.com\nCheck out our reading list :\_https://stoicismpod.com/suggested-reading\nRead our articles :\_https://stoicismpod.com/category/articles\n--\nOnline copy of Meditations (Long) :\_https://link.stoicismpod.com/meditations-long\nOnline copy of Meditations (Casaubon) :\_https://link.stoicismpod.com/meditations-casaubon\nOnline copy of Seneca's Letters :\_https://link.stoicismpod.com/letters\n--\nLearn more about your ad choices.
