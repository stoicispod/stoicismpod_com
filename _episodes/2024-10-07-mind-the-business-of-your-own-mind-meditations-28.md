title: Mind the business of your own mind (Meditations 2.8)

  In this episode, I discuss Meditation 8 from Book 2 of Meditations. Marcus
  Aurelius reflects on how people rarely suffer from not understanding the
  thoughts of others but are bound to suffer if they don’t observe their own
  thoughts. I explain how spending too much time worrying about what others
  think leaves us no energy to examine our own thoughts and work toward virtue.
  This meditation is not about ignoring others, but rather about prioritizing
  our mental energy wisely. We can care for others, but we must avoid wasting
  time on trivial judgments about why someone acts a certain way or holds an
  opinion about us.

  I tie this to a broader Stoic understanding of how most people are "sick" with
  ignorance, often chasing material desires or misconceptions about what is
  good. This lack of understanding causes people to live in private worlds of
  delusion, where their judgments are skewed by false perceptions. Stoicism, on
  the other hand, teaches that the only true good is virtue, and once we embrace
  that understanding, we gain clarity on how lost most people are. By focusing
  on our own character and its alignment with virtue, we avoid the misery that
  comes from spending too much time concerned with the faults of others.

  "Men are not easily seen to be brought into evil case by failure to consider
  what passes in another's soul; but they who do not read aright the motions of
  their own soul are bound to be in evil case." - Meditations 2.8
