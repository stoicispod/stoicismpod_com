title: The Commitment To A Moral Life (Meditations 3.7)
date: Tue, 11 Feb 2025 10:00:00 -0000
description: >-
  In this episode, I explore Meditations 3.7, where Marcus Aurelius reminds us
  that nothing should take priority over Virtue. Many misunderstand Stoicism as
  a philosophy of detachment, resilience, and isolation, but in truth, it is
  profoundly prosocial. Being a Stoic means fulfilling our roles within the
  broader human community, not retreating from it. I challenge the popular but
  misguided idea of Stoicism as a philosophy for lone survivalists,
  demonstrating how its core teachings—from Zeno to Epictetus to
  Seneca—emphasize duty, justice, and engagement with the world. True Stoicism
  isn’t about turning inward; it’s about striving for moral excellence in every
  interaction.


  “Never value as an advantage to yourself what will force you one day to break
  your word, to abandon self-respect, to hate, suspect, execrate another, to act
  a part, to covet anything that calls for walls or coverings to conceal it. A
  man who puts first his own mind and divinity, and the holy rites of its
  excellence, makes no scene, utters no groans, will need neither the refuge of
  solitude nor the crowded streets. What is most worthwhile, he will pass his
  days neither in pursuit nor in avoidance, and it is no concern at all of his
  whether the time be longer or shorter for which he shall have the use of the
  soul in its bodily envelope; for even if he must be released at once, he will
  depart as easily as he would perform any other act that can be done with
  reverence and sobriety, being careful all his life of this one thing alone:
  that his understanding be not found in any state which is foreign to a
  reasonable social being.” --(Meditations 3.7)


  TAKEAWAYS


  — The highest priority in Stoicism is the pursuit of Virtue—nothing should
  stand in its way.

  — Stoicism is not a philosophy of detachment or isolation but of prosocial
  engagement and duty.

  — A Stoic does not seek solitude or approval; they act justly regardless of
  external validation.
