title: Keeping Stoic Focus When Angry
date: Mon, 04 Dec 2023 17:00:00 -0000
description: "Today's episode features Meditations 5.26. I delve into the profound teachings of Marcus Aurelius, focusing on the importance of maintaining rational control over bodily afflictions. Marcus advises us to accept natural sensations like pain without labeling them as good or bad. He emphasizes the need to avoid letting physical discomforts, such as pain from minor injuries, overwhelm our rational faculties. This concept resonates with me personally, as I share an ongoing struggle to manage my anger towards someone who, despite not harming me in a Stoic sense, has greatly upset me.\_\nI explore the difficulty of practicing Stoic teachings in real life, acknowledging the challenge of not holding grudges or judging others harshly for their actions. Reflecting on Seneca's wisdom about the universality of human error and the importance of forgiveness, I discuss how holding onto anger can be more harmful to ourselves than to others. I recommend a pragmatic approach: giving ourselves space and time to process our feelings before confronting the source of our anger. This method may not be strictly Stoic, but it is a practical way to handle intense emotions, ensuring we don't react in ways that could escalate conflicts or harm relationships.\nThank you for joining me on this journey of self-reflection and philosophical exploration. Remember, if you're dealing with anger, it's okay to take a step back and give yourself time to cool off.\n--\nSupport my work directly on Patreon : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nSubscribe to my Everyday Stoicism blog : https://everydaystoicism.com\nJoin the Actual Stoicism discord community : https://stoicismpod.com/discord\n--\nOnline copy of Meditations (A.S.L Farquharson) : https://link.stoicismpod.com/farquharson\nOnline copy of Enchiridion (Elizabeth Carter) : https://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html\nLearn more about your ad choices.
