title: Stoicism Isn’t Toxic, But Misunderstanding It Can Be (Meditations 3.6)
date: Tue, 04 Feb 2025 10:00:00 -0000
description: >-
  In this episode, I explore Meditations 3.6 and the challenge Marcus Aurelius
  presents to those seeking the Good life: is there anything higher than
  justice, truth, temperance, and fortitude? If we find something greater, we
  should pursue it wholeheartedly. But if not, then we must commit ourselves
  fully to Virtue. I also address the common misconception that Stoicism
  promotes emotional repression or toxic perfectionism. True Stoicism is about
  disciplined reasoning, self-improvement, and moral alignment—not detachment or
  indifference. If the pursuit of Virtue is the highest aim, then what could be
  better than dedicating our lives to it?


  “If you discover in the life of man something higher than justice, truth,
  temperance, fortitude, and generally speaking than your understanding
  contented with itself, where it presents you behaving by the rule of right,
  and satisfied with destiny, in what is assigned to you and is not yours to
  choose; if, I say, you see something higher than this, turn to it with all
  your heart and enjoy the supreme good now that it is found…” - Meditations 3.6


  TAKEAWAYS

  + The highest good in Stoicism is the pursuit of Virtue—nothing else surpasses
  it.

  + True Stoicism is not about emotional repression but about disciplined
  reasoning and moral alignment.

  + The pursuit of an ideal, even if unattainable, is valuable in itself and
  fuels lifelong self-improvement.
