  In this primer episode for Season 2, I introduce the reboot of the podcast. If
  you're new here, welcome—I'm excited to have you join this journey. This
  season is not a reimagining but a refresh, building on the knowledge I've
  accumulated since I first started this podcast in 2022. While Season One was
  an exploratory beginning, Season Two aims to dive deeper into the Stoic canon
  with greater insight and understanding.

  In this episode, I explain some key Stoic vocabulary you'll need to know, such
  as "Prokoptôn," "Virtue," "sage," "impression," and "assent." I also discuss
  the Stoic concepts of "Good," "Bad," and "indifferents," clarifying common
  misconceptions about Stoicism and how it guides us in making moral choices.

  Additionally, I touch on the Stoic Circles of Concern and introduce my Pyramid
  of Concern, a tool I developed to help us better understand and prioritize our
  roles and responsibilities in the context of Stoic ethics.

  Finally, I discuss the Dichotomy of Control—or, as I prefer to call it, the
  Dichotomy of Choice—emphasizing the importance of focusing on what we can
  choose and letting go of what we cannot.

  This season will revisit the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, starting with
  Book 2, Meditation 1. Together, we'll explore Stoic philosophy in a way that
  is both deep and accessible, aiming to help you progress on your path toward
  Virtue.

  Thanks for being here, and I'm looking forward to this journey with you. See
  you next week!
