title: 'Oikeiôsis: The Stoic Opposite of Selfishness'
date: Mon, 01 Jan 2024 10:00:00 -0000
description: >-
  In today's episode, I'm discussing Oikeiôsis, an essential part of Stoic
  philosophy and a cornerstone for developing a virtuous character. I'll revisit
  Hierocles' Circles of Concern, illustrating our interconnectedness with
  family, community, humanity, and the biosphere, and introduce the Pyramid of
  Concern, a new perspective emphasizing the foundational role of broader
  concerns in our well-being.

  As we explore Oikeiôsis, I'll explain how caring for others as ourselves isn't
  just noble; it's a practical approach to living a fulfilled life. You've been
  with me through nearly 300 episodes, and now, as we begin 2024, we'll spend a
  whole month dissecting and applying Oikeiotic thinking and acting. We'll hear
  from ancient Stoics, apply their wisdom to modern challenges, and I'll even
  pose a question for you Spotify listeners to engage with directly in the
  mobile app.

  Let's start this year by understanding and embracing the full scope of our
  concerns, shaping them to enrich not just ourselves, but the entire world we
  are a part of.
