title: Without The Sage Is Stoicism Broken?
date: Tue, 14 May 2024 09:00:00 -0000
description: "In today's episode of Practical Stoicism, I delve into a challenging question often posed by newcomers to Stoicism: \"If the Stoic Sage is purely aspirational, what motivation do we have to work on our character?\" Addressing this, I explore why striving for unattainable ideals, such as perfect health or the perfect dinner, remains essential, despite their inherent impossibility.\_\nI draw parallels between the pursuit of excellence in various fields—be it medicine, fitness, or culinary arts—and the philosophical journey toward becoming a better Stoic. This episode unpacks the importance of perpetual improvement and how it enriches our lives and professions, despite the certainty that perfection is unachievable.\_\nI also challenge the notion that the unattainable nature of sagehood undermines the value of Stoicism. By embracing the continuous pursuit of virtue, we acknowledge that while perfection is a myth, the journey toward it is filled with meaningful growth and self-improvement. Join me as I argue that the quest for a virtuous life, much like life itself, is about valuing the journey, not just the destination.\n--\nBecome a Patron : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nDownload the daily app : https://stoicism260.com\nSubscribe to the Newsletter : https://practicalstoicism.net\nEnroll in the course : https://understandingstoicism.com\nOrder my book : https://stoicismpod.com/book\nJoin the Society of Stoics : https://societyofstoics.org\nLearn more about your ad choices.
