  Accepting Mortality: Marcus Aurelius on the Purpose of Death (Meditations
  2.12)

description: >-
  In this episode, I discuss Meditation 12 from Book 2 of Meditations, where
  Marcus Aurelius reflects on the transient nature of life, death, and the
  things we often fear or desire. Marcus emphasizes that everything in the
  Universe is impermanent, including our bodies, desires, and even the monuments
  we create. These fleeting aspects of life, he suggests, should be seen as
  trivial or “cheap” when compared to the pursuit of virtue.

  Marcus also contemplates death, framing it not as something to be feared but
  as a natural and necessary part of the Universe’s self-sustaining design.
  Death is not just Nature’s handiwork; it is her well-being—a crucial component
  in maintaining balance. By accepting death as a fundamental part of the
  Cosmos, we can shift our focus from fearing mortality to embracing a life
  aligned with our values. Marcus further encourages us to consider who we look
  to for praise and honor, questioning whether their judgments align with virtue
  or merely societal vanity.

  In Stoic philosophy, the true aim of life is not to evade death but to live
  justly and virtuously. By understanding death as a natural phenomenon, we can
  resist the urge to abandon our values out of fear. Instead, we stand firm in
  the pursuit of a life that honors virtue, regardless of life’s brevity.

  "How all things are vanishing swiftly, bodies themselves in the Universe and
  the memorials of them in Time; what is the character of all the things of
  sense, and most of all those which attract by the bait of pleasure or terrify
  by the threat of pain or are shouted abroad by vanity, how cheap,
  contemptible, soiled, corruptible, and mortal:—these are for the faculty of
  mind to consider. To consider too what kind of men those are whose judgements
  and voices confer honour and dishonour; what it is to die, and that if a man
  looks at it by itself and by the separating activity of thought strips off all
  the images associated with death, he will come to judge it to be nothing else
  but Nature's handiwork. But if a man fears Nature's handiwork he is a mere
  child; and yet death is not merely Nature's handiwork, but also her
  well-being. To consider also how mortal man touches God and through what organ
  of himself, and when that part of him is in what sort of condition." -
