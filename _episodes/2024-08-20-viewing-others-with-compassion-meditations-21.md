  In this first episode of Season 2, we dive into one of my favorite meditations
  from Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 2.1. I’ll be using the Farquharson
  translation throughout this season, and today, I’m excited to get started.

  Meditation Quoted:

  "Say to yourself in the early morning: I shall meet today inquisitive,
  ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, uncharitable men. All these things
  have come upon them through ignorance of real good and ill. But I, because I
  have seen that the nature of good is the right, and of ill the wrong, and that
  the nature of the man himself who does wrong is akin to my own (not of the
  same blood and seed, but partaking with me in mind, that is in a portion of
  divinity), I can neither be harmed by any of them, for no man will involve me
  in wrong, nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him; for we have come
  into the world to work together, like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the
  rows of upper and lower teeth. To work against one another therefore is to
  oppose Nature, and to be vexed with another or to turn away from him is to
  tend to antagonism." -- (Meditations, 2.1)

  In this episode, I explore how Marcus’s reflection captures the essence of
  Stoicism by reminding us of the importance of viewing others with compassion,
  even when they act out of ignorance. We are all striving toward Virtue, and
  acknowledging our shared imperfections can foster a deeper sense of unity and
  purpose.

  I also discuss the Stoic concepts of Virtue, the Unity of Virtue, and the idea
  that no one does wrong knowingly. These ideas challenge us to reconsider our
  judgments of others and ourselves, recognizing that everyone is acting from
  their own perceived understanding of what is right—even if that understanding
  is flawed.

  Finally, I leave you with two questions to ponder and discuss in the comments:
  How well do you balance your service to the greater good with your own
  personal well-being? And how do you manage the conflict between your higher
  ideals and the distractions of daily life?
