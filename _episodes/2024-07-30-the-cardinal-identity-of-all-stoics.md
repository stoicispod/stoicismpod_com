title: The Cardinal Identity Of All Stoics
date: Tue, 30 Jul 2024 09:44:56 -0000
description: >-
  In this episode, I delve into the concept of identity from a Stoic
  perspective, prompted by recent thoughts and experiences. I discuss how we
  often identify with various subordinate identities, such as our gender,
  profession, nationality, or personal preferences, and how these can sometimes
  overshadow our true identity.

  I propose that, according to Stoic philosophy, we all share a single Cardinal
  Identity: Human Citizen of the Cosmos. This identity transcends all
  subordinate identities and unites us as part of a greater whole. I explore the
  potential pitfalls of over-identifying with our subordinate identities, which
  can lead to division and a narrow view of ourselves.

  Through this discussion, I aim to shift the focus from these subordinate
  identities to our shared Cardinal Identity. By recognizing and embracing this
  Cardinal Identity, we can better fulfill our roles and contribute to the
  greater good of the cosmopolis.

  Join me as I explore how understanding our true identity can help us live more
  virtuous and fulfilling lives, and how we can balance our various roles and
  characteristics without losing sight of our shared humanity.
