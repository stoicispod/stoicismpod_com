description: "\"Of him that brought me up, not to be fondly addicted to either of the two great factions of the coursers in the circus, called Prasini, and Veneti: nor in the amphitheatre partially to favour any of the gladiators, or fencers, as either the Parmularii, or the Secutores. Moreover, to endure labour; nor to need many things; when I have anything to do, to do it myself rather than by others; not to meddle with many businesses; and not easily to admit of any slander.\" Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 1.2\n--\nGet rid of ads and support our work :\_https://link.stoicismpod.com/members\nHang out with us in our free listener community:\_https://link.stoicismpod.com/discord\nJoin our daily Stoic journaling program :\_https://link.stoicismpod.com/journaling\nJoin our Stoic mentoring community :\_https://link.stoicismpod.com/path\_\n--\nView a list of our sponsors :\_https://link.stoicismpod.com/sponsors\n--\nVisit our website :\_https://stoicismpod.com\nCheck out our reading list :\_https://stoicismpod.com/suggested-reading\nRead our articles :\_https://stoicismpod.com/category/articles\n--\nOnline copy of Meditations (Long) :\_https://link.stoicismpod.com/meditations-long\nOnline copy of Meditations (Casaubon) :\_https://link.stoicismpod.com/meditations-casaubon\nOnline copy of Seneca's Letters :\_https://link.stoicismpod.com/letters\n--\nLearn more about your ad choices.
