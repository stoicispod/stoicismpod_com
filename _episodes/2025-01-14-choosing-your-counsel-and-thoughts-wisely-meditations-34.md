title: Choosing Your Counsel and Thoughts Wisely (Meditations 3.4)
date: Tue, 14 Jan 2025 10:00:00 -0000
description: >-
  In this episode, Tanner explores the rich insights of Meditations 3.4 by
  Marcus Aurelius, focusing on four main Stoic principles. Marcus warns against
  wasting time on unnecessary concerns about others, emphasizing opportunity
  cost and the importance of focusing on appropriate external and internal
  matters. Tanner also discusses the practice of habituating virtuous
  thoughts—those we would not be ashamed to express openly—as a step toward
  moral excellence. The meditation highlights the innate rationality within us,
  gifted by the Logos, and reminds us that our purpose is to act in alignment
  with justice and reason. Finally, Marcus advises caution in choosing whose
  counsel to value, urging Stoics to avoid being swayed by those who do not
  pursue Virtue themselves.


  MEDITATION TEXT


  “Do not waste the balance of life left to you in thoughts about other persons,
  when you are not referring to some advantage of your fellows—for why do you
  rob yourself of something else which you might do—I mean if you imagine to
  yourself what so and so is doing, and why; what he is saying or thinking or
  planning, and every thought of the kind which leads you astray from close
  watch over your governing self? [full meditation can be found at
