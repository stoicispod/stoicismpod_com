title: Is Inner Peace the Goal of Stoicism? (Meditation 3.12)
date: Tue, 25 Mar 2025 08:16:00 -0000
description: >-
  In this episode, I walk through Meditations 3.12, where Marcus Aurelius claims
  that if we pursue Virtue with sincerity and without distraction, we will live
  “the blessed life.” But what does that really mean in Stoic terms? We examine
  what “blessed” refers to (spoiler: it’s Eudaimonia, or inner peace) and ask
  whether the Stoics pursued Virtue for its own sake or for the sake of that
  peace.


  I argue that Virtue leads to inner peace by removing destructive emotions like
  anger, fear, shame, and grief—what the Stoics called the pathē. When we
  understand Nature and act in accordance with it, those emotions lose their
  hold on us. But that inner peace isn’t the goal of Stoicism—it’s a byproduct
  of doing the work of moral development for its own sake. That work is the
  point.


  MEDITATIONS 3.12


  “If you complete the present work, following the rule of right, earnestly,
  with all your might, with kindness, and admit no side issue, but preserve your
  own divinity pure and erect, as if you have this moment to restore it; if you
  make this secure, expecting nothing and avoiding nothing, but content with
  present action in accord with Nature and with heroic truth in what you mean
  and say, you will live the blessed life. Now there is no one who is able to
  prevent this.”


  THREE TAKEAWAYS


  — Virtue leads to inner peace: By eliminating destructive emotions through
  rational understanding, we create a calm mind and a steady heart.

  — The pursuit of Goodness should be its own reward: Stoicism teaches us to
  seek Virtue not as a means to peace, but as the end in itself.

  — Eudaimonia is a byproduct, not the goal: Inner peace naturally follows from
  living rightly, but it’s not what we should be aiming at directly.
