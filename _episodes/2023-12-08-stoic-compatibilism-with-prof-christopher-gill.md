title: Stoic Compatibilism with Prof. Christopher Gill
date: Fri, 08 Dec 2023 14:30:03 -0000
description: >-
  In this episode, I engage in a thought-provoking conversation with Professor
  Christopher Gill of the University of Exeter. As a renowned scholar in Ancient
  Thought and author of several influential books, including the recent
  "Learning to Live Naturally," Professor Gill shares his deep insights into
  Stoicism. Our discussion centers on Stoic Compatibilism, Nature, Free Will,
  and Autonomy, offering a unique perspective on these classical concepts.

  Professor Gill elaborates on the Stoic view of universal causal determinism
  and how it coexists with human autonomy and rationality. He emphasizes that
  adult humans, unlike other beings, possess the ability to make rational
  choices, setting them apart in the deterministic framework of the universe.
  The conversation also addresses common misconceptions about Stoicism,
  particularly the notion of fatalism.

  A highlight of our discussion is Professor Gill's explanation of the Stoic
  interpretation of free will and autonomy, which differs significantly from
  modern concepts. He clarifies the Stoic stance on determinism and
  responsibility, illustrating how past experiences and actions shape our
  decisions, yet we remain the architects of our destiny through the character
  we develop.

  Additionally, Professor Gill discusses his latest book, shedding light on core
  Stoic ethics, the process of learning to live in accordance with nature, and
  Stoicism's relevance to contemporary ethical challenges, including
  environmentalism.

  This episode not only deepens the understanding of Stoicism but also connects
  ancient philosophy to modern-day contexts, making it a must-listen for anyone
  interested in the intersection of ancient wisdom and contemporary thought.
