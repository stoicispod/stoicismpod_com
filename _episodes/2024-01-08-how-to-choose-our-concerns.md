description: >-
  This episode of "Practical Stoicism" delves into the concept of Oikeiôsis,
  focusing on how to identify the aspects of life one should actively concern
  themselves with. I emphasize the distinction between caring about something
  and actively concerning oneself with it. Drawing from Stoic philosophy, the
  episode unfolds in four steps:

  #1 - Realize that you're human: Acknowledging that my most proximal concerns
  must be for ourselves and other humans. The Stoic perspective asserts that our
  ethical concerns must follow this order: self > family > friends > community >
  humanity > non-human animals > biosphere

  #2 - Identify your strengths, weaknesses: Recognizing our strengths and
  weaknesses to make informed choices about where to direct our concerns. This
  involves assessing whether we are financially, physically, or mentally
  equipped to engage in specific actions.

  #3 - Identify the roles you cannot unchoose: Recognizing roles and
  responsibilities that are inherent, non-negotiable, or arise from our choices.
  Balancing these roles with new concerns to ensure harmony and avoid abandoning
  essential responsibilities.

  #4 - Choose what you want: Empowered to freely choose concerns based on
  personal desires, keeping in mind the logical and rational defense developed
  through previous steps. This step ensures that our choices align with our
  strengths, limitations, and existing roles.

  The episode concludes with the freedom to choose without shame, armed with a
  rational understanding of personal limitations and priorities. The host
  encourages listeners to share their chosen concerns on Spotify, fostering a
  community of inspiration and diverse perspectives.
