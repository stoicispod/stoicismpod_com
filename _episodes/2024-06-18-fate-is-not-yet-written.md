title: Fate Is Not Yet Written
date: Tue, 18 Jun 2024 05:17:23 -0000
description: >-
  In this episode, I delve into the concept of fate within Stoic philosophy, a
  topic that often sparks varied opinions. The Stoics believed in a
  deterministic universe, where a physical causal chain dictates the flow of
  events. However, this idea can feel restrictive, suggesting that nothing we do
  could be otherwise.

  I explore how we can view this deterministic outlook as both true and untrue,
  using Chrysippus' analogy of the cylinder and the cone to illustrate how we
  react to external forces based on our unique 'shapes.' I explain the Stoic
  distinction between corporeal and incorporeal things, proposing a similar
  division within the causal chain: a physical chain we cannot control and a
  metaphysical chain influenced by our rational choices.

  Despite the Stoic belief that the mind and its processes are physical, I
  introduce the concept of 'lekta' or sayables, which are incorporeal yet
  impactful. I argue that choices, like lekta, are incorporeal outcomes of
  physical processes, influencing the physical world.

  This episode suggests that while fate may seem predetermined, our choices play
  a crucial role in shaping the future. We are co-authors of our destiny, and
  recognizing this power is essential for the pursuit of Virtue.

  Join me as I navigate this intricate discussion, challenging the idea of a
  finalized fate and emphasizing our role in co-authoring what happens next.
