title: The Illusion of Free Will? (Meditations 3.10)

  In this episode, I explore Meditations 3.10, where Marcus Aurelius reminds
  himself—and us—that we only ever live in the present moment. He urges us to
  remember three things: life is short, the space we occupy is small, and fame
  is fleeting. But why does he emphasize this? Because knowing who we are and
  becoming the best version of ourselves is what truly matters.


  This discussion dives into the Stoic understanding of determinism and free
  will. I explore how our choices shape our character over time, using
  Chrysippus’ analogy of cones and cylinders to explain how habitual actions
  determine our future choices. Along the way, I challenge common
  misunderstandings about fate, examine neuroscientific insights on
  decision-making, and explain why our focus should be on habituating ourselves
  toward virtue rather than trying to control the uncontrollable.


  Meditations 3.10:

  “Therefore throw all else aside, and hold fast only these few things; further
  calling to mind at the same time that each of us lives only in the present,
  this brief moment; the rest is either a life that is past, or is in an
  uncertain future. Little the life each lives, little the corner of the earth
  he lives in, little even the longest fame hereafter, and even that dependent
  on a succession of poor mortals, who will very soon be dead, and have not
  learnt to know themselves, much less the man who was dead long years ago.”


  Three key takeaways from this episode:


  — The present moment is the only place where we have power. We cannot change
  the past, and the future is beyond our control.

  — Habitual choices shape our character. Stoicism teaches us to be intentional
  about the habits we form because they dictate how we act when we’re not
  thinking.

  — We cannot control everything, but we can control how we respond. Our role is
  not to change the world but to become virtuous people who act justly within
  the world we inhabit.
