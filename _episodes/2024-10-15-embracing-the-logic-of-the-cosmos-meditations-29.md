title: Embracing The Logic Of The Cosmos (Meditations 2.9)
date: Tue, 15 Oct 2024 09:26:00 -0000
description: >-
  In this episode, I reflect on Meditation 9 from Book 2 of Meditations. Marcus
  Aurelius reminds us to always remember the nature of the Cosmos and our place
  within it. He emphasizes that the Cosmos is a rational and self-sustaining
  system, and as part of it, we share in that logic and beneficence. Marcus
  urges us to act in accordance with Nature, meaning that we should strive to be
  rational and beneficent, just as the Cosmos is.

  I explore how the Cosmos, though not consciously acting like a human, sustains
  itself in a way that allows everything within it to exist and perform its
  roles. By understanding this, we realize that no external force can prevent us
  from making choices in line with our rational nature. While external
  circumstances may influence us, it is ultimately our choice how we respond to
  them. Marcus reminds us that it is not the external situation, but how we make
  choices, that determines whether we act with wisdom and virtue.

  I also touch on the Stoic concept of personal responsibility, explaining how
  we are always accountable for our choices. Even when provoked, such as by an
  unkind boss, it is our choice how we react, and only we can choose to act with
  virtue or vice. The key is not just in the choice itself, but in the reasoning
  behind that choice. By internalizing the understanding that we are in control
  of our responses, we can aim to align ourselves with the rational and
  beneficent nature of the Cosmos.

  "Always remember the following: what the nature of the Whole is; what my own
  nature is; the relation of this nature to that; what kind of part it is of
  what kind of Whole; and that no man can hinder your saying and doing at all
  times what is in accordance with that Nature whereof you are a part." -
  Meditations 2.9
