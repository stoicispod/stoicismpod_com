title: Context is Everything (Meditations 3.15)
date: Tue, 15 Apr 2025 09:00:00 -0000
description: >-
  In today’s episode, I take a close look at Meditations 3.15, which reads:
  “They have not learnt to know the manifold significance of theft, of sowing,
  of buying, resting, seeing what ought to be done. This depends not on the
  bodily eye but on another kind of vision.” Marcus is pointing us toward a
  crucial insight: context matters deeply. Nothing, not even theft or sowing, is
  always straightforwardly good or bad. I explore how Stoicism teaches us to see
  beyond the surface of actions and recognize that judgment requires more than a
  quick glance — it requires deeper vision.


  Through everyday examples like stealing food in desperate circumstances, or
  working late to avoid home responsibilities, I show how the same action can
  shift moral weight depending on the context. I also reflect personally,
  sharing my own journey as a new father and how my choices about health and
  fitness must now serve not just me, but my son and my role as a parent. Stoic
  practice calls for this kind of honest evaluation of our choices, moment by
  moment.


  Finally, I encourage you to examine your own judgments of yourself and others
  — are they fair, are they just, or are they lazy? Each day offers a new chance
  to try harder, to see more clearly, and to act more justly.


  MEDITATION


  “They have not learnt to know the manifold significance of theft, of sowing,
  of buying, resting, seeing what ought to be done. This depends not on the
  bodily eye but on another kind of vision.” — Meditations 3.15


  THREE TAKEAWAYS


  — Context shapes moral judgment far more than surface appearances.

  — Actions like theft or work can be preferred, dispreferred, or neutral
  depending on the situation.

  of Virtue.
