title: How many second chances have you already wasted? (Meditations 2.4)
date: Mon, 09 Sep 2024 09:00:00 -0000
description: >-
  In this week's meditation, we explore Meditation 2.4 from Book 2 of the
  Meditations. The conversation centers around the inevitability of death, the
  urgency of utilizing the present moment, and the Stoic approach to perceiving
  and appreciating life on Nature’s terms.

  Meditation Quoted: "Remember how long you have been putting off these things,
  and how many times the gods have given you days of grace, and yet you do not
  use them. Now is it high time to perceive the kind of Universe whereof you are
  a part and the nature of the governor of the Universe from whom you subsist as
  an effluence, and that the term of your time is circumscribed, and that unless
  you use it to attain calm of mind, time will be gone and you will be gone and
  the opportunity to use it will not be yours again." — Meditations, 2.4
