title: How Environment Shapes Moral Progress (Meditation 3.9)
date: Tue, 04 Mar 2025 10:00:00 -0000
description: >-
  This episode explores Meditations 3.9, where Marcus Aurelius urges us to
  revere our rational faculty. In Stoicism, rationality is our greatest
  gift—it’s the tool that allows us to pursue Virtue, shape our moral character,
  and ultimately live in accordance with Nature. But how do we cultivate this
  faculty, especially when our environment doesn’t support moral growth?


  I discuss how we are shaped by our surroundings, often without realizing it.
  If we’re immersed in Stoic teachings, the path to moral improvement becomes
  clearer. If we’re surrounded by different influences—religious, ideological,
  or otherwise—we internalize those instead. This is why the Stoics believed
  that introducing philosophy too early could be a form of indoctrination rather
  than genuine moral development.


  As a new father, I reflect on the challenge of raising a child without forcing
  beliefs upon them. The goal isn’t to dictate what’s right but to create an
  environment where they can discover Virtue for themselves. The same applies to
  guiding friends and family—lead by example rather than preaching. For those
  struggling to commit to moral improvement in a non-Stoic environment, I offer
  three actionable steps: recognize the need for guidance, seek a mentor, and
  eventually mentor others when ready.


  Marcus Aurelius reminds us that our rational judgment must align with Nature.
  By shaping our habits and seeking wisdom, we give ourselves the best chance at
  living a life of Virtue.


  “Reverence your faculty of judgement. On this it entirely rests that your
  governing self no longer has a judgement disobedient to Nature and to the
  estate of a reasonable being. This judgement promises deliberateness, familiar
  friendship with our fellow human beings, and to follow in the train of the
  gods.” — Meditations 3.9
