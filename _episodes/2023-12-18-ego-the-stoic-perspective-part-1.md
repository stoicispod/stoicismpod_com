title: 'Ego: The Stoic Perspective (Part 1)'
date: Mon, 18 Dec 2023 09:51:16 -0000
description: "Today begins a three-part series exploring ego. I question whether ego is the 'big bad boogey monster' of Vice, setting the stage for a week-long thematic exploration.\_\nInitially, I discuss a meditation from Marcus Aurelius, which, although not explicitly about ego (since the concept didn't exist in his time), relates to the idea of self-importance.\nI note the difference between the everyday use of 'ego' and its clinical or scientific definitions. The colloquial understanding often equates ego with being overly self-important or pompous.\nMarcus Aurelius' meditation (5.24) provides a Stoic perspective, urging us to consider our insignificance in the grand scheme of the universe. This viewpoint is a direct challenge to the ego-centric view, emphasizing how minuscule our existence is compared to the vastness of matter, time, and historical events.\nMy interpretation of Marcus' message is not to push us towards Nihilism but rather to offer a cosmic perspective that helps temper ego-driven thoughts. This Stoic approach aims to provide a reality check to our self-importance, reminding us that we're not the center of the universe. This acknowledgment doesn't mean our lives are meaningless, but it suggests that we should keep our ego in check to maintain a balanced perspective.\nMy goal with this series is to thoroughly explore the concept of ego, providing practical advice and insights that listeners can apply in their daily lives. By the end of the week, the aim is to have a comprehensive understanding of ego and how it relates to the pursuit of virtue in Stoicism.\_\n--\nBecome a Patron : https://stoicismpod.com/members\nJoin the Discord : https://discord.gg/stoicism\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Today begins a three-part series exploring ego. I question whether ego is the 'big bad boogey monster' of Vice, setting the stage for a week-long thematic exploration. 
Initially, I discuss a meditation from Marcus Aurelius, which, although not explicitly about ego (since the concept didn't exist in his time), relates to the idea of self-importance.
I note the difference between the everyday use of 'ego' and its clinical or scientific definitions. The colloquial understanding often equates ego with being overly self-important or pompous.
