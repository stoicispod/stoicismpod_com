  Hey everyone, Tanner here. Today I'm going to share something with you that's
  a little bit different. This is not an episode. This is what's called a feed
  drop.


  A feed drop is when I feature a podcast I think you might like and then you
  listen to a little bit of it and if you like it you go find out more about it
  on your own. And this podcast is called Money for Couples.


  If you have ever found yourself wondering as a couple, where is all our money
  going? You're definitely not alone. That is exactly what episode 192 of Money
  for Couples titled "We Spend 98% of What We Make, Where Is It All Going?" is
  all about. This episode dives into real stories and practical strategies that
  help couples stop money fights.


  If you like it, you find it helpful and you want to hear the full
  conversation, just search for Money for Couples wherever you're already
  listening to this podcast right now.


  Episode Description: 

  Justin (40) and Deepika (32) are stuck in a frustrating financial loop:
  despite their high income, they feel like they’re living paycheck to paycheck.
  Deepika dreams of buying a house someday, but the couple can’t seem to
  identify where their money is going—or how to escape the cycle of credit card
  debt. Justin has a side hustle that he’s eager to grow, but he’s struggling to
  get the same level of commitment from his business partners. For years,
  they’ve been focused on survival, not dreaming about the future. Now, they’re
  realizing that their lack of a shared vision for their finances is keeping
  them from the life they want. Can Justin and Deepika kick their old habits,
  create a better strategy for managing their money, and finally start living
  their Rich Life?
