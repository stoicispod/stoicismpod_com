title: Act with precision, dignity, and love (Meditations 2.5)
date: Mon, 16 Sep 2024 09:00:00 -0000
description: >-
  In this episode, I begin by correcting a mistake I made about the word
  "Prokoptôn," clarifying that it is the singular form, not the plural. We then
  dive into Meditation 5 of Book 2, which focuses on acting with precision,
  dignity, love, freedom, and justice in every moment, as if it were your last.
  I break down the importance of being aligned with nature and explain how
  Marcus Aurelius emphasizes the need to be in awe of the Cosmos, rather than
  "god-fearing" as some translations might suggest. I also touch on how we
  should fulfill our roles and responsibilities according to our nature, using
  the Stoic principle of Oikeiosis to live a life aligned with the Cosmos.

  "Each hour be minded valiantly as becomes a Roman and a man to do what is to
  your hand with preciseness . . . and unaffected dignity natural love freedom
  and justice; and to give yourself repose from every other imagination. And so
  you will if only you do each act as though it were your last freed from every
  random aim from willful turning away from the directing Reason from pretense
  self-love and displeasure with what is allotted to you. You see how few things
  a man need master in order to live a smooth and godfearing life; for the gods
  themselves will require nothing more of him who keeps these precepts." -
  Meditations, 2.5
