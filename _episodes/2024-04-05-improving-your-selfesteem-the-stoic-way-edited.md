  Apparently this episode got uploaded only in part. I'm sorry it took me nearly
  a month to realize it (been busy with the new baby), but this is the full
  episode. Thanks for letting me know and for being patient.

  In today's episode of "Practical Stoicism," I tackle the deeply personal and
  often challenging topic of improving self-esteem. At its core, low self-esteem
  is a lack of self-approval, a revelation that can evoke a powerful emotional
  response in many of us. As we delve into this subject, I guide you through an
  introspective journey, starting with the acknowledgment of our
  self-disapproval and moving towards understanding and eventually overcoming
  these feelings. By differentiating the aspects of ourselves that we disapprove
  of for our own reasons versus those influenced by external expectations, we
  embark on a path to genuine self-acceptance. This episode not only seeks to
  deepen your understanding of self-esteem from a Stoic perspective but also to
  provide practical steps towards cultivating a healthier relationship with
  yourself.
