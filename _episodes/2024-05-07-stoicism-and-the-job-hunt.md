description: >-
  In this podcast episode, I delve into the Stoic approach to selecting a career
  or job, offering insights tailored for both high school students and adults. I
  stress the significance of assessing existing roles, ethical considerations,
  and personal motivations when embarking on the job search journey. Throughout
  the discussion, I provide practical advice on salary negotiation, benefits
  evaluation, and company research. Above all, I emphasize the Stoic principle
  of fulfilling one's duties in service to broader concerns, guiding listeners
  on integrating Stoic principles into their job search process.
