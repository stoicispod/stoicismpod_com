description: >-
  In today's episode, despite battling sickness, we delve into Meditation 24
  from Book 5 of Marcus Aurelius' 'Meditations'. We explore the profound Stoic
  concept of our minuscule existence in the vastness of the universe and the
  flow of time. Marcus prompts us to acknowledge our tiny role in the grand
  chain of causation, reminding us of our shared substance with the cosmos. This
  meditation serves as a humbling yet empowering reflection on our place in the
  world. Additionally, we discuss the importance of practicing philosophy in
  daily life, moving beyond mere reading to active application. Join us as we
  dissect these timeless Stoic insights, offering practical 'homework' to truly
  embody Stoic principles in our journey towards virtuous living.
