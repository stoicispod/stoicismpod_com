title: Are Humans Naturally Selfish? A Stoic Exploration
date: Tue, 21 Jan 2025 10:00:00 -0000
description: >-
  In this episode, Tanner answers a listener question from Wyatt Bennett: “What
  does Stoicism say about human nature? Are humans naturally selfish?” Exploring
  this through the Stoic concept of Oikeiôsis and the Circles of Concern, Tanner
  explains how our understanding of responsibilities expands as we mature.
  Starting from self-concern in infancy, we grow to care for family, friends,
  community, humanity, and even the planet. Tanner challenges Thomas Hobbes’
  pessimistic view of human nature, offering a Stoic perspective that emphasizes
  the dynamic and evolving nature of human rationality and moral growth.


  TAKEAWAYS



  Stoicism sees human nature as dynamic, with our rational and moral concerns
  expanding over time.


  Self-concern in early life is natural but not permanent; growth involves
  widening our circles of responsibility.


  Nature’s alignment isn’t always pleasurable for individuals but serves a
  greater universal purpose.
